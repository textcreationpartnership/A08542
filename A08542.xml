            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT beeing greatly forward of mine owne inclination (right Honourable) but forced by the importunitie of my friends to make ſome triall of my ſelfe in this exerciſe of tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I haue aduentured vpon a peece of work, not indeed the moſt profitableſt, as intreating of armes, nor yet altogether fruitleſſe, if example may ſerue, as being hiſtoricall, but the while, either to be borne withall for the delight, or not to be refuſed for the ſtrangeneſſe: far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I meane not to make boaſt of my trauaile, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was offred, not made choice of, as there appeared likewiſe little libertie in my firſt yeelding. The earneſtneſſe of my friends perſwaded me that it was conuenient to laie foorth my talent for increaſe, or to ſet my candle on a candleſticke, &amp; the conſideration of my ſufficiencie droue me to thinke it better for my eaſe, either quite to burie my talent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to auoide the breaking of thriftleſſe debtes, or rather to put my candle cleane out, then that it ſhould bewraie euery vnſwept corner in my houſe, but the opinion of my friends iudgement preuailed aboue mine own reaſon. So vpon hope to pleaſe them, I firſt vndertooke this labour, &amp; I haue gone through withall, the rather to acquaint my ſelfe with mine olde reading: whereto ſince the diſpatch therof, I haue made, my friends priuie, &amp; vpon good liking, with requeſt thereto I haue paſſed my graunt vnto them for the publication, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring for my ſelfe the order for the dedication, ſo as I ſhuld thinke beſt, either for the defence of my worke or for ſome perticular merit towards mee. And heerein I tooke no long leaſure to finde out a ſufficient perſonage. For the manifold benefites receiued from your honourable parents, my good
<pb facs="tcp:13855:3"/>Lord and Ladie, quickly eaſed me of that doubt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented your honour vnto my view: whome by good right I ought to loue and honour in eſpeciall, as being of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, at whoſe hands I haue reaped eſpeciall benefit. The which benefit if I ſhould not ſo gladly profeſſe openly, as I willingly receiued being offered, I might well be challenged of vnkindneſſe, but were I as able to make good my part, as I am not ignorant what may bee required at my handes, I would hope not to be found vngratefull. In the meane time this my trauaile I commend vnto your Lordſhip, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame ſo to accept thereof, as a ſimple teſtimonie of that good will which I bare to your parents while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then being their ſeruant, &amp; now doe owe vnto their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring after their deceaſe for their demerits. Vnder your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors protection I ſhall leſſe feare the aſſault of the enuious, &amp; of your honours good acceptation, I haue ſome hope in the mildneſſe of your Lordſhippes nature, not doubting but that as your Lordſhip hath giuen no ſmall ſignification in this your noble youth of wiſdome and courage to ſo many as know you, it being the onely ſupport of your aunceſtors line: ſo the ſame likewiſe will maintaine your aunceſtours glorie, and the hope of your owne vertues with affabilitie &amp; gentleneſſe, which was the proper commendation of your parents. The almightie increaſe this hope with the other vertues before named, to the good hope of your Countries peace, your Princeſſe ſafetie, and your owne honour, with the ioy of your kindred &amp; friends, whom not a few your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents good deſeruing hath aſſured vnto you, and of whoſe earneſt praiers you ſhall not faile, to further your well doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

            <p>THou haſt béere gentle Reader, the hiſtorie of <hi>Trebatio,</hi> an Emperour in <hi>Greece:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtorie.</note> whether a true hiſtorie of him in déed, or a fained fable, I wot not, neither did I greatlye ſéeke after it in the tranſlation, but by me it is done into Engliſh for thy profit &amp; delight. The chiefe matter therein contained, is of exployts of warres, and the parties therein named, are eſpecially renowmed for their magnanimitie &amp; courage. The authors purpoſe appeareth to be this, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thereby, &amp; to ſet on fire the luſtie courages of young Gentlemen, to the aduauncement of their line, by enſuing ſuch like ſteps. The firſt tongue wherein it was penned was the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> in which nation by common report, the inheritaunce of all worldly commendation hath to this day reſted. The whole diſcourſe in reſpect of the ende not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie: for the varietie &amp; continuall ſhifte of freſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verie delightfull: in the ſpeaches ſhort and ſwéete, wiſe in ſentence, and warie in the prouiſion of contrarie acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. For I take the grace thereof to be rather in the reporters deuice, then in the truth of this report, as I wold that I could ſo well impart with thée that delight, which my ſelfe findeth in reading the Spaniſh: but ſeldome is the tale carried cleane from anothers mouth. Such deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as I haue made I hope thou wilt friendly accept, the rather for that it is a womans worke, though in a ſtorye prophane, and a matter more manlike then beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth my ſexe. But as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manlineſſe of the matter,<note place="margin">That a woman may vvrite of vvarre.</note> thou knoweſt that it is not neceſſarie for euery trumpetter or drumſlare in the warre to be a good fighter.<note place="margin">That a woman may vvrite of vvarre.</note> They take wages onely to incite others, though themſelues haue priuie maymes. and are therby recureleſſe. So gentle Reader if my trauell in Engliſhing this Authour, may bring thée to a liking of the vertues héerein commended, and by example thereof in thy Princes &amp; Countries quarrell to hazard thy perſon, &amp; purchaſe good name, as for hope of well deſeruing my ſelfe that way, I neither bend my ſelfe thereto, nor yet feare the ſpeach of people if I be found backward, I truſt euery man holdes not the plough, which would the ground were tilled,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:4"/>and it is no ſinne to talke of <hi>Robinhood,</hi> though you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhot in his bowe: Or be it that the attempt were bolde to intermeddle in armes, ſo as the auncient <hi>Amazons</hi> did, and in this ſtorie <hi>Claridiana</hi> doth, and in other ſtories not a few, yet to report of armes is not ſo odious, but that it may be borne withall, not onely in you men which your ſelues are fighters, but in vs women, to whome the benefit in equall part apperteineth of your victories, either for that the matter is ſo commendable that it carryeth no diſcredit from the homelyneſſe of the ſpeaker, or for that it is ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally knowen, that it fitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The inuention, diſpoſition, trimming, and what elſe in this ſtorie, is wholy another mans, my part none therein but the tranſlation, as it were onely in giuing enterteinment to a ſtraunger, before this time vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with our countrie guiſe.

I haue notwithſtanding made counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance onely to this gentleman, whom neither his perſonage might ſufficiently commend it ſelfe vnto my ſexe, nor his behauiour (being light &amp; ſoldier like) might in good order ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint it ſelfe with my yeares. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the queſtion now ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of my choice, not of my labour, wherefore I preferred this ſtorie before matter of more importance. For anſwere whereto gentle reader, the truth is, that as the firſt motion to this kind of labour came not from my ſelfe, ſo was this peece of worke put vpon me by others, and they which firſt counſailed me to fall to worke, tooke vpon them alſo to bée my taſkemaſters and ouerſéers, leaſt I ſhould be idle, and yet becauſe the refuſall was in my power, I muſt ſtand to anſwere for my eaſie yéelding, &amp; may not be vnprouided of excuſe, wherin if I ſhould alledge for my ſelfe, that matters
<pb facs="tcp:13855:4"/>of leſſe worthineſſe by as aged yeares haue bene taken in hande, &amp; that dayly new deuiſes are publiſhed, in ſongs, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, enterludes, and other diſcourſes, and yet are borne out without reproch, onely to pleaſe the humour of ſome men: I thinke I ſhould make no good plea therin, for beſides that I ſhould finde therby ſo many knowen enimies, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en men haue bene authors of ſuch idle conceits, yet woulde my other aduerſaries be neuer the rather quieted. For they would ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as well the one as the other were all naught, and though peraduenture I might paſſe vnknowen amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a multitude, and not be the onely gaze or odde partie in my ill doing, yet becauſe there is leſſe merit of pardon if the fault be excuſed as common, I will not make that my defence which cannot helpe me, and doth hinder other men. But my defence is by example of the beſt, amongſt which, many haue dedicated their labours, ſome ſtories, ſome of warre, ſome Phiſicke, ſome Lawe, ſome as concerning go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, ſome diuine matters, vnto diuerſe Ladyes and Gentlewoman. And if men may and do beſtow ſuch of their trauailes vpon Gentlewomen, then may we women read ſuch of their workes as they dedicate vnto vs, and if wée may read them, why not farther wade in them to the ſearch of a truth. And then much more why not deale by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in ſuch arguments, eſpecially this kinde of exerciſe, béeing a matter of more héede then of déepe inuention or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite learning, and they muſt néedes leaue this as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that in their dedications, they minde not onely to borrowe names of worthie perſonages, but the teſtimonies alſo for their further credite, which neither the one may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund without ambition, nor the other graunt with out ouerlightneſſe: if women be excluded from the viewe of ſuch workes, as appeare in their name, or if glorie onely be ſought in our common inſcriptions, it mattereth not whether the partyes be men or women, whether aliue or dead. But to returne whatſomeuer the truth is, whether that women may not at all diſcourſe in learning, for men laie in their claime to be ſole poſſeſſioners of knowledge, or whether they may in ſome manner, that is by limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

               <p>The ſtorie ſaith thus: That if at anie time Fortune, being alwaies vncertain &amp; variable, ſhewed hir ſelfe more friendlie to the <hi>Greekes,</hi> than to all men beſides, &amp; if euer the <hi>Grecians</hi> were feared in all the world, it was in the time of <hi>Trebatio</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Alicante,</hi> which man by right line deſcended from the noble &amp; ancient bloud of <hi>Moloſſo,</hi> the ſecond ſonne of ſtrong <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and in the third diſcent from the great <hi>Achilles,</hi> which was ſlaine in the warres at <hi>Troye.</hi> This <hi>Trebatio</hi> in the xxv. yeare of his age, reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Epyrus,</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Pirrhus</hi> and his aunceſtours had bene Kings. He was ſtrong and valiant in armes, and endowed with ſo manie graces, that his fame in that time was ſpred ouer all the world, and that there was neither King nor Emperour, but he was glad to hold him for his friend. Now it happened in his time by the death of the Emperour <hi>Theodoro,</hi> the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire to be void, for that <hi>Theodoro</hi> had no ſonne, and the Empire was to bée giuen by election: ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Electors not finding any whom with ſe good reaſon they might chooſe for Emperor as the great <hi>Trebatio,</hi> as well for his great valure, as for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb facs="tcp:13855:6"/>from ſo noble a race. They with the willing &amp; ioynt aſſent of all the Emperialls, named him vnto the Empire, and brought him with great honour to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, (if before for his great fame they had praiſed and honored him) now much more they held him déere, hauing in ſome part ſeene &amp; knowen him. Becauſe he was of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions very noble, pleaſant, louing to all, liberall, curteous. ſufferable, pitifull, and aboue all very deſirous to entertein in his Court, valiant and worthy Knights, whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored aboue all the Princes of the earth. So that his court flouriſhed with Princes and Knights, as well ſubiects, as ſtraungers, which much magnified his great eſtate, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe held continuall excerſe in armes with them, as being lyke enclined to nothing. His vertue by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> report of ſuch as knew him, was ſo rare, that it was generally thought none of his predeceſſors to haue had aduauntage ouer him, but rather he was of greater force then any one of them all. For many men were witneſſes of his mightie ſtrokes. He was called the great <hi>Trebatio,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>8.</hi> foote in height, &amp; very ſtrong timbred, ſo that without proofe of his manhood, they might thereby make coniecture of his force. In his life, cuſtomes and conditions he was alway ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable &amp; curteous, that neuer might be noted in him one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fault. Wherefore his Hiſtorians ſaye, that he was the crowne of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> &amp; the cléere mirrour of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; knights of the world. Whence alſo this his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle boroweth this title, eſpecially hauing therin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the meruailous deeds of the <hi>Knight of the Sunne,</hi> with <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> both ſons vnto <hi>Trabatio.</hi> Since whoſe time, all the aduentures of the ancient &amp; famous knights wer clean forgotten, and ſince whoſe time, neither <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> of whome <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeketh, neither any other ſongs or ſonets, ballads or enterludes, wer heard in <hi>Greece,</hi> onely with theſe two Knights, they were familiarly acquainted.

                  <p>The King of Hungarie pretending a title to the Empire, ſetteth himſelfe against the Emperor Trebatio. </p>
               </argument>
               <head>Cap. 2.</head>
               <p>IT appeareth by an ancient <hi>Greeke</hi> Cronicle, that the Emperour <hi>Helio</hi> the third predeceſſor in the Empire of <hi>Trebatio</hi> had two ſonnes, the eldeſt of the which two, the father being deceaſed, was choſen Emperour, the other was married with a Princeſſe, inheretrix of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> wherby he became Lord &amp; ruler of that kingdome. The firſt ſonne which was elected for Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour departed without iſſue. For which cauſe the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> choſe another, which was the predeceſſor of <hi>Theodoro.</hi> This ſéeing the ſecond ſonne of <hi>Aelio,</hi> which then reigned in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and iudging that with moſt reaſon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was his, as gréeued with the election, he aſſembled his power againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Grecians,</hi> thinking to be Lord ouer them by force. In the ende, as he was not ſo mightie as they, ſo he was vanquiſhed and ſlaine before he might attaine his purpoſe. Yet from that time forth, all the kings which ſuccéeded in <hi>Hungary,</hi> pretended alwaye that the right of the Empire reſted in them by way of inheritaunce, and there neuer failed warres &amp; diſſentions betwéen the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> and the <hi>Greekes</hi> vpon this occaſion. In lyke man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when the great <hi>Trebatio</hi> was choſen for Emperour, then reigning in <hi>Hungarie</hi> the King <hi>Tiberio,</hi> a verye ſtrong man and of great courage, beſides of more might then all his aunceſtours. For he had in his ſubiection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb facs="tcp:13855:7"/>the Kingdome of <hi>Hungary,</hi> many other Prouinces, as <hi>Holland, Zeland, Flaunders, Zweueland, Bauare, Austrich, Almaine, Alba, Denmarke, Marcomandia, Perſia,</hi> and other Regions, with the which he déemed himſelfe one of the mightieſt Kings in the world. This <hi>Tiberio</hi> knowing the election of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and being more attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the deſire of the Empire then any of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours were, (as it was to be gotten by warre) ſo he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by ſummons y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt of eſtate throughout his land, and declaring vnto them his will, he commaunded to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the people they might, for to inuade <hi>Greece.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, to the ende his power might yet be greater, hée determined to marrie his Daughter vnto ſuch a one, as would and could maintaine his quarrell. This Mayden was called <hi>Briana,</hi> the moſt beautifull Princeſſe that was to be found in all thoſe parts, being by the onely report of hir excellencie, ſued vnto by manie worthie Princes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Olyuerio,</hi> King of great <hi>Britaine.</hi> This young Knight ſtrong and valiant, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enamoured on the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> through the great fame of hir beautie, had before diſpatched his Ambaſſadors towards the King hir father, to requeſt hir for wife. To the which hir Father becauſe he hadde already vndertooke the battaile againſt the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> eaſely conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, vpon condition that the Prince ſhould come into <hi>Hungarie</hi> with <hi>20000.</hi> choſen men of warre, for to aids him in the purſute of his claime againſt the Emperour.</p>
               <p>This when Prince <hi>Edward</hi> vnderſtood, he had ſo great deſire to haue the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> that by and by he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his requeſt, and ſo as ſpeedely as he might, he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the people that the King <hi>Tiberio</hi> required of him, and with the conſent of his Father, he departed from great <hi>Britaine</hi> toward <hi>Hungarie,</hi> giuing intelligence before vnto the King <hi>Tiberio</hi> of his comming. The King knowing the ſuccours which came vnto him, appointed a daye when all his Hoaſt ſhould méete together, and finding himſelfe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13855:7"/>ſo great power, in the meane while vntil the prince came, he reſolued to make a roade into <hi>Greece,</hi> ſacking all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle townes he might, before that the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> ſhould perceiue it. Afterwardes if the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> ſhould come to ſuccour his ſubiects, then to ioyne battayle with him, at ſuch time as the Prince ſhuld approch, which thing he put in practiſe diligentlye. For with that power which he had, he entered into <hi>Greece,</hi> forraging the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, taking little townes of no great force, burning &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſo much as he might, to the intent, that the people of other fenced Cities ſtroken with feare, might abandon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to flight, &amp; enféeble their forces. Howbeit King <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berio,</hi> had not paſſed in <hi>Greece</hi> xxx. miles, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Trebatio</hi> hauing knowledge of it, came agaynſt him with an hoaſt of knights ſo valiant, that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt alarme, the <hi>Hungarian</hi> reculed, &amp; by the chaſe of his enimies, was forced to retire home into the citie of <hi>Belgrado,</hi> which is in <hi>Hungary.</hi> Ther he fortified himſelfe, &amp; manned the towne, vnwilling as yet to goe into the field, vntill the Prince of great <hi>Britaine</hi> ſhould arriue, by whoſe comming their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers being ioyned, he thought he might giue the battayle vnto the Emperour <hi>Trebatio.</hi> Albeit he caried about him a mayme incurable in his bodie, not by anie ſtroke lent him by his enimie, but by the onely conceipt of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours vertue. For he had ſéene the Emperour demeane himſelfe more worthely, then any of thoſe that came with him, &amp; namely in a kinſman of his, a very ſtrong Knight, whom the Emperour at one blowe as it were deuided in two péeces. This, as it might be, made him kéepe his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe he himſelfe confeſſed the valor of the Emperor to be aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> report of men, notwithſtanding he had heard ſufficiently of the Emperours proweſſe. But becauſe theſe things are not mentioned, but to giue beginning to this hiſtorie, we run them briefly ouer, not rehearſing the great déeds of armes that the Emperor and his people did in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging the Citie, becauſe we haue other matters more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <q>Know you mightie Emperour, that when the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> my maſter, firſt tooke vppon him the entrie into <hi>Greece,</hi> he wold not haue done it (although he hath ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie an hoaſt as is ſéene) but in hope that before he ſhuld be eſpied &amp; met withall, there ſhould come to his help Prince <hi>Edward</hi> ſonne to the king of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> with <hi>20000.</hi> knights.

               </p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:13855:8"/>
               <p>This ſayd the priſoner: but the Emperour minding to knowe more of the matter, demaunded of him, where the Princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> remained, and of what age ſhe might be. The priſoner aunſwered him. <q>My Lord, ſhe is with the Quéene <hi>Augusta</hi> hir mother in the Moneſtarie of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which is néere <hi>Buda,</hi> a pleaſaunt and delectable houſe, wherin none are lodged but Nunnes, &amp; the Quéenes Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen. The Princeſſe is of the age of <hi>14.</hi> yeares, &amp; be aſſured that ſo many as ſhall ſée hir, will iudge hir rather a goddes then a woman, ſo much hir beautie doth excel all the gentlewomen of the world. Now ſo ſoone as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince ſhall land, he will ſtraight waies take his iourny towards the Moneſtarie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer, becauſe it is ſo appoynted by the King hir father, The King himſelfe will not be there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not be abſent in ſuch a buſie time from the Citie.</q> When the priſoner had thus ſayd, the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> commaunded him to be ſet frée, without ſpeaking other thing to his people, but with a ſorrowfull &amp; troubled countenaunce, he withdrew himſelfe into a ſecret chamber of his Imperiall tent. Where toſſing in his conceit diuers &amp; ſundrie fancies, he endured a wilfull impriſonment with out any baile or maynpriſe. <q>Thus that force, which neither by till, turney, nor barriers, neither by ſpeare nor ſworde, neither by mallice of the enimie, nor pride of the mightie, might at anie time be ſubdued, was now vanquiſhed by the onely heare-ſay of a Gentlewomans commendation. Nay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valiant heart, which he held forcible inough againſt all the world, failed in his owne defence againſt a delicate damzell whom he had neuer ſéene. What force is it that may repulſe this euill, ſith that with ſuch flattering cloſes it ouerthroweth ſo many noble hearts and ſtrong bodies.</q> But to returne, the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> ſo much burned in loue with the Princes <hi>Briana,</hi> that alreadie he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the damage receiued in his Countrey, his trauaile out of his Countrey with a huge armie, the conſuming of his treaſure for to wreake his anger on the King <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berio,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13855:9"/>onely he deuiſed vpon this, how to giue remedie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to his amorous paſſion. For as the fire was great which enflamed him, ſo was the remedie by all ſemblaunce farre from him. Becauſe that on the one part he was hindred by the enmitie betwéene him and hir father, ſo that he durſt not require hir for wife, and on the other ſide, ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy promiſed to the Prince of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> who had put himſelfe on his iourney for the attaining of hir perſon, ſo that likewiſe the King could not take hir from him, to giue vnto his enimie. Theſe things bred ſuch griefe, vnto the Emperour, as that he hoped for nothing but to die. And ſo turning and ouerturning in his thought a thouſand ſort of remedies, without finding any which might ſatiſfie him, he conuaied himſelfe into his moſt ſecret Tent, and there remained three dates, not ſuffering any of his people to haue acceſſe vnto him, or ſpeach with him, except ſome ſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſeruitors, from whome likewiſe he would willinglye haue exempted himſelfe, but that he would not die ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately. Thoſe of the Camp, which ſaw the ſodain change and alteration in the Emperour, as they knew not the cauſe of it, ſo wer they much abaſhed and careful to know what it might be. Some imagined that the delaye of the warre, and the comming of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of his trouble, and ſo hoping that he ſhoulde well ouercome that griefe ſhortly, they left him to his reſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had reſolued vpon the purſute of this which folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the next chapter.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>O how many impediments be therein left to hinder vs, from enioyeng it: O what a common thing is it to die, and how manie euer ſawe happie end in it? How ioyfull and pleaſaunt was to <hi>Paris</hi> the deſired match of <hi>Helena,</hi> and how ſorrowfull and lamentable was the ende, not onely to him, but to his parents and bretheren and the greateſt parte of all <hi>Aſia?</hi> For not onely in <hi>Greece,</hi> but in all the out Ilandes thereaboutes was bewept his bitter Bridall. With how great care and dilligence doe men haſten on the cauſes of their care, occaſions of their heauineſſe, meanes of their paines, and matter for theyr griefe, and doe not content themſelues with the continuall afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein Fortune ſchooleth them? But by new meanes

But why do we complaine on fortune, do we not bend her armes to fight w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, doe we not mainteine her weapons which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture lighteth on our owne neckes.

Fortune hath vſed the like vnto at her. The Prince now being on his way, two of the kings knights were diſpatched before by ſome ſecret by wayes very well knowen vnto them to aduertiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quéene &amp; princeſſe of the approching of the Prince. Theſe two held on their way, not aſcried by the ambuſh, but ſo ſoone as the prince with his knights had entred in the thicket, they wer preſently diſcouered by the Emperour, who was alreadie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13855:11"/>armed with his rich armour, &amp; mounted vppon a ſtrong &amp; light horſe. The Emperor taking a great ſpeare in his hand verie ſharpe, &amp; well ſtéeled for the purpoſe, went alone aſide out of the woode with a ſofte pace, to encounter with the Prince &amp; his knightes, and being come right before them, ſaid vnto them. Know you knights that this paſſage is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, except you leaue your ſhéelds &amp; your names in them. For that a Lady whom I honour &amp; ſerue hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to do it, whoſe loue I could not otherwiſe obteine. The Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was by nature verie ſtout, &amp; by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation giuen to ſomewhat leſſe modeſtie in his talke then behoued ſuch a Prince, howbeit for this and other faults he was a verie valiant &amp; ſtrong knight, ſuch a one as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great <hi>Britaine,</hi> neither in the kingdome of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> was thought to haue his péere. But as he vnderſtood y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> demaund of the knight, very wroth he anſwered him. <q>By God knight, if the king <hi>Tiberio</hi> were as certeine of the victorie againſt the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> as I hope to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice thy folly, then the Prince of <hi>England</hi> ſhould not néede to come from ſo farre a countrie to giue him helpe. Take thou quickly that part of the fielde as ſhall ſéeme good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée, and with one onely choiſe thou ſhalt ſée how déere and bitter thy loue hath bene vnto thée.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the Prince had ſaid this, and had pronounced with his owne mouth, that cruell dome, not well foreſéeing his owne fall, hee tooke a great ſpeare from one of his knights and broched his horſe with the ſpurres to méets the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. (This he did, not for that his knightes woulde not haue put themſelues in the aduenture before him, euerie man claiming to be firſt, but for that no reaſon ſufficed him. For his ſtoutneſſe and his vnmeaſurable pride, made him to forget the force of his enimie, and yet his enimye ſtoode before him ſo great and ſo bigge made, that hée ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a Gyant). But this Princes aduerſe fortune and vnhappie deſtinies woulde him to be the formoſt, ſo that the mightie <hi>Trebatio</hi> knewe it, as well by the rithes of
<pb facs="tcp:13855:12"/>his armour as by the talke which had paſſed betwéene him and his knights, and béeing verie glad to ſee him the firſt which he met, he ſayd vnto himſelfe, O that my Speare were now greater and ſtronger, &amp; the bead forged by <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> that it might not ſtaye in the armour of this Knight, for that according as I ſee him great and ſtrong, ſo I feare hée will eſcape my handes, and then my trauaile ſhall bée all in vaine. Thus as he ſayde, they by and by did put both their Speares in their reſtes, and giuing either horſe his bridle, they ranne together with ſuch furie, that they made the earth to tremble, and yet the lightneſſe of theyr horſes was ſuch, that it ſéemed the graſſe yéelded not vnder theyr féete. The Prince hit the Emperour in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the ſhéelde, and pearcing farther left the head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the fine and well ſtéeled armour, whereby the ſtaffe broken in many ſhéeuers made a great whiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ayre. But the Emperours ſtroke was much more fell, for hée leuelled it with ſuch force that it entered not onely into the ſhéeld and ſtrong armour of the Prince, but paſſed through vnto his amorous heart all bedewed with bloud a whole armes length.</p>
               <p>Then the Prince fell dead, executing the ſentence which hée had giuen in theſe woordes, that that loue ſhoulde bee very déere and bitter. When his people ſawe him ſtretched vppon the ground, there might no ſorrowe bée compared vnto theirs, and as raging madde they ranne all together vpon the Emperour, thinking to put in practiſe theyr dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anger vpon his carcaſſe. Some with Speares and other with Swoordes ſtrake him on all partes with great rage and haſt, ſo that if his armour had not béene verie good, in ſhort ſpace they had hewed it in péeces. But that moſt valiaunt Gréeke no leſſe ſtrong then anie of his aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, bearing his fine and ſharpe ſwoord, turned himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in ſuch manner, that he ſheathed it in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The firſt whom he met he cleaued vnto the eyes, the ſeconds arme he cut off by the elbow, &amp; being ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13855:12"/>hée ouerthrewe the thirde at another blowe, neither ſtaied hée héere, but in his rage, he dealt blowes and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many, which for feare accounting him rather a Diuell of hell, then a knight, put themſelues to flight. Albeit they might haue recouered ſome courage in that they wer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and choſen knightes, alwaies againſt one knight onely. But the reaſon was for that at this time the Emperours knightes ſhewed themſelues out of the woode. So that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede by the great manhoode of their Lord they found none left on liue ſaue two knightes of the kings which were knowen by their Hungarian baſes. Thoſe the Emperour commaunded to be kept carefully, for the thing before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>This béeing done, the knights and other footmen which the Emperour had brought with him to guide his carriage tooke all the dead bodies vpon their horſes, without leauing any thing which was theirs, &amp; altogether they caried them into the thicke of the woode, from whence they before came out, there. in the thickeſt thereof they made a great pit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which they threw the Prince and the knights, ſaue the Engliſh baſes, &amp; the kings letters which were néedfull for his purpoſe, they couered them with earth in ſuch ſort, that there was neuer memorie of them. At the time that the Prince was entered, the Emperour beeing of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pittifull, felt ſo great dolor in his heart, that the teares iſſued abundantly from his eyes, ruing the loſſe of ſo great a Prnce ſlaine out of his owne Countrie in the beautie of his age, which alſo yéelding a great ſigh, which ſéemed to haue come from the bottome of his heart, he ſaide with a troubled and low voice in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O vnhappie and vnfortunate Prince, God knoweth how ſorrowfull and grieuous thy death is to mée, and howe faine I would haue giuen remedie in ſome other manner, to that I moſt deſired, and although thou waſt mine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and come in fauour of the king <hi>Tiberio</hi> to take from me my land and high eſtate, yet would I not haue bene ſo
<pb facs="tcp:13855:13"/>cruell an enimie vnto thée, but the entire loue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> draue me more thereto, then mine owne enmitye. Now I wiſh that by ſome other meanes I might haue bene relieued, and not to haue bought my life by thy loſſe. But as loue is tyrannous, ſo meruaile not though he want pittie towardes thée, which coulde not otherwiſe purchaſe it to himſelfe: Pardon me therefore, O mightie and worthy Prince, and iudge if thou wert aliue what thou wouldeſt doe, if by my death thou mighteſt finde remedye of thy loue.</q> The Emperours knights which heard theſe words, and ſawe the teares trickling downe his manly chéekes, perceiued well howe much the death of the Prince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted him. And they ſayde amongeſt themſelues, that by good right the Emperour deſerued the prayſe of the moſt noble and worthy Prince of the world. But hauing made an end, the Emperour cauſed to be brought before him the two knights belonging vnto <hi>Tiberio.</hi> Theſe two were very fearefull of the death, ſéeing the things which were already done, &amp; eſpecially when they knew him to be the Emperor <hi>Trebatio,</hi> whom they held as their mortall enimie. Nowe when they came before him, the Emperour ſaid to them. <q>If you will do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I command you, &amp; kéepe ſecret that which I tell you, I will not onely pardon you the death which I haue giuen to your fellowes, but alſo I wil bring you with me into mine Empire, where you ſhall bée verye well contented.</q> The knights better ſatiſfied then they wer, becauſe he promiſed them life, before not hoping but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death, with good will they yéelded themſelues to doe all that hée would, with all, ſwearing into his Emperiall hands their faith &amp; obeiſance. Then ſaid the Emperour, <q>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I wold haue you do is this, I haue great deſire to haue the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Briana</hi> for wife, &amp; this may not be done, except I go in the name of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> to enſure my ſelfe to her in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> monaſtery of the riuer, for the which it is neceſſarie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you two being knowen of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> queene &amp; the Princeſſe, ſhuld go in my company, &amp; ſay that I am Prince <hi>Edward.</hi> Now ſirs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13855:13"/>diſcouer not my ſecret to any perſon, vntill y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therevnto by me, and in ſo dooing, you ſhall doo nought either againſt your Lorde or Kingdome, ſith in this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Princeſſe looſeth not, and the King with all his ſubiects win perpetually, for that by this means, the great warres and contentions begun, ſhall take ende.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After that the Emperor had ſaid theſe and other things, whereby the Knights vnderſtoode his will, it greued them not a whit of this talke, but they wer rather ioyous, wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng the benefit which the King, the kingdome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> and all his ſhoulde reape thereby, and eſpecially the Princeſſe, by obtaining to huſband, the moſt noble and worthy Prince of all chriſtendome, as well for his perſon, as for his eſtate, and ſo with good will they ſubmitted themſelues to doo him pleaſure, and what els he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them. With this, the Emperour &amp; his Knights tooke the letters which wer directed to the Quéene &amp; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and with more hope to atchieue their enqueſt, they put on the Engliſh baſes, which made them ſéeme Engliſh men, then taking their way toward the Moneſtarie of the riuer. In the way, the Kings knights fold the Emperour, how two of their felowes were gone before to giue notice vnto the Princeſſe, of Prince <hi>Edwards</hi> comming, and that therefore it were good to goe well aduiſed, for they ſhould méete them by the way. The Emperour allowed their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, &amp; charged his people vntil they approched néere them, not to diſcloſe themſelues, leaſt they retiring, their ſecretes might be layde open. Now fortune iumped ſo euen with the Emperour, as that all things ſuccéeded on his ſide, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the accompliſhment of his deſire, which ſhall be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the chapter following.</p>

God hath made me ſo fortunate that I haue obtained the good wil of the king your father, &amp; of the Quéene your mother for to haue you to wife. Only now I want the conſent of your part, which the King by his letters prayeth you to giue me, and I for the deſire that I haue to be yours, beſéech you not denie it me, for with it I may account my ſelf the happieſt knight of all the worlde.</q> And with theſe wordes, kiſſing the Kings letters, he deliuered it into hir handes, which the Princeſſe receyuing, with a graue and ſober counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and after taking it to the Archbiſhoppe for to read, the meane time made aunſwere ſoftly on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I wold to God moſt worthy Prince, that I were ſuch a one as with reaſon might deſerue ſome part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paines which you haue taken onely to ſée me, or that I might in ſome little reſpect recompence the great pleaſure you haue done to me, &amp; to all this kingdome, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to ſuccor vs
<pb facs="tcp:13855:15"/>with your great force and power, but ſith deſert doth want ſo much in me, I will accompliſh that which the duetie of obedience vnto the King my father forceth me vnto, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I muſt ſubiect my will vnto his commandement, yet I ſo conſider of this your offer and requeſt, as that from this time I will dare to compare with you in like happineſſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>While theſe words were in ſpeaking, the Archbiſhop began to read the Kings letters, wherein onely was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his conſent, with the deſire of diſpatch, that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon the Princes comming they ſhould be married.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop, with both their conſents, taking their hands, married them with all the ceremonies and wordes which the Church ordeineth. After this, the Emperor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the faire Princeſſe, and with vnſpeakable gladneſſe kiſſed hir on the white and red chéekes, and from thence, brought hir into a gorgeous chamber, where they draue forth the reſt of the day, with very amorous and delectable talke, which ſo much the more ſet his loue on fire, as hée procéeded farther in his pleaſaunt daliaunce. Albeit ere night, the moſt puiſant Emperor was not altogether qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted in his thought, for feare leaſt ſome one which knewe the Prince might haue bewrayed them, at length, béeing certaine that none in the Moneſtarie, had ſéene either the one or the other, but onely the Kings foure knights, &amp; his own men, which kept the matter cloſe inough. When the houre of ſupper approched, he ſupped with ſome pleaſure, &amp; ſo held on a great part of the night till it was time to take his reſt. Then the Emperour was ledde to one ſide of the Moneſtarie, wherein there was a rich and ſtately lodging, where he lengthened the night with manye fancies, not hauing as yet reached into the very deapth of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, albeit ſtilled a lyttle, with that which alreadye had happened. The beautifull Princeſſe after leaue taken of the Emperour, accompanied the Quéene hir Mother.</p>
               <p>Becauſe, vntill that the warre was ended betwéene the King hir Father and the Emperour, ſhe was deſirous to

               <p>THE Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> remained thrée dayes in the Moneſtarie of the riuer, not hauing opportunitie to talke with the Princeſſe alone, becauſe ſhe was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to giue conſent to his deſire, vntil the warre with the Emperour ſhould be finiſhed This inconuenience trobled his thought, and increaſed his melancholy, as nothing more for that the terme which the King had ſet for his returne was alreadie expired, and béeing afrayde leaſte the King would ſend for him, whereby his fault ſhould be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, without giuing remedie to that which had bene the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of his griefe, in ſuch wiſe he was tormented that he could neither ſléepe nor eate. And in his imagination he did naught els but gaze on the Princeſſe, expecting time when he might alaie the heate of his amorous paſſion.</p>
               <p>But whether it were Fortune, or the will of God, it fel ſo out, that there was begotten betwéene them, the fruite of their deſire. For one morning walking in his chamber, he eſpied out of a windowe the Princeſſe alone in hir night gowne, going towards a freſh and pleaſant garden butting vpon his lodging, (the gardein before he had not ſéene.) Into this gardein entered none but the Princeſſe and hir Gentlewomen. As he ſaw ſo good and proſperous a time, the moſt ioyfull man that euer was, he went towards the pleaſeunt gardeine, and finding no entrie, but by the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Princeſſe, the doore whereof was ſhut, he tooke
<pb facs="tcp:13855:16"/>two of thoſe ſpeares which his knights had brought, and rearing them vp againſt the wall with the blunt end vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, (as he was verie nimble) he lifted himſelfe vpon them lightly, and eaſely ſlidde downe betwixte them into the gardeine, without béeing ſéene of anie, eſpecially not of the Princeſſe, who was vnwitting of ſuch a leape.</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe was nigh a Fountane well ſet about with Roles and Ieſſamines, kembing and dreſſing of hir yeolow haire. Now when ſhe ſawe hir ſelfe thus ſodein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken by the Emperour, with a fearefull ſtarte, ſhée roſe from whence ſhe was, and gently ſmiling as ſomwhat ouertaken with ſhamefaſtneſſe, ſhe beſhrowed him in this ſort. <q>Aſſuredly my Lord, néedes muſt the hurt be great which you haue ſuſtained by your leape, and great is the iniurie which the gardeine hath receiued by your enterie, becauſe that in it none haue come, but either my ſelfe, or my Gentlewomen: for whoſe ſolace it was firſt plotted out. For this cauſe God hath ſhewed me ſuch fauour, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Emperour, becauſe I haue lodged my heart in your excellent beautie, and well may the bodie lawfullye enter, where the heart is harboured. Let not therefore my entrie, good madame, ſéeme ſtraunge vnto you, ſith that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houre nor moment I maie depart from you. And if this my rudenes hath procured you any paine, by the frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which you haue giuen me, my heart ſhall make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vnto your beautie, vnder whoſe ſafe conduct without demaund of leaue, my bodie hath entred.</q> The good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hauing thus ſayd, imbraced and kiſſed hir, and not leauing any leaſure of reply, made hir to ſit down by him neere vnto the well. This place was ſo hedged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with odoriferous Roſes, and ſwéete ſmelling Ieſſamine, that they might not be perceiued by anie. And the gentle mourmure that the running water made vpon the pebble ſtones, agréeing with the delicate layes which diuers birdes made vpon the gréene boughes, encreaſed ſo much the longing deſire of the Emperour, that caſting
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13855:16"/>howe to winne the fauour of his Lady, already his tounge failed to ſpeake, and his hearing to receiue that which ſhée ſpake. She then all trembled, as knowing his purpoſe, and through feare greatly deſired to haue ſhunned that place, but the Emperour caught hir betwéene his armes, and with ſuch haſt to ende his ſute, lefte hir vnfurniſhed of hir aunſwere.</p>
               <p>At that time as the burning beames of the Sunne began with his golden rayes to looke through the thicke Ieſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, all the fortunate aſpects intermedling their forces, at that time, by the grace of the Almightie, were begotten theſe two noble children the <hi>Knight of the Sunne,</hi> &amp; <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer,</hi> the beames of whoſe knightly deeds ſo ſhined through the world, as that the worthy prowes of their predeceſſors were thereby eclipſed.</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Plaudite</hi> of his paſſion, and the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princeſſe now became a wife ſomewhat againſt hir will, but when ſhe ſaw no remedie to that which was paſt, ſhe comforted hir ſelfe in that he was hir lawful huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and therefore ſhe pardoned him his boldneſſe in tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hir. Theſe two louers ſhortened the time with good agréement, vntill the Emperour at his departure, tooke his leaue of hir to mounte vp the waye he came, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne into his lodging. The Princeſſe remained alone in the gardeine, vntill hir Gentlewomen came for hir to dinner,</p>
               <p>After this, yet the Emperor ſoiourned there thrée daies, at the ende whereof, fearing the kings iealouſie ouer his tarieng, and the euent of his ſending for, he tooke his leaue of the Quéene and the Princeſſe, not without the curteſie of many teares on each part, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Princeſſe whom he lefte ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dolefull, albeit ſadder would ſhe haue ben, if ſhe had foreſéene the long time of his abſence. <hi>C. iiij.</hi>

               <p>THe Empereur <hi>Trebatio</hi> thus hauing departed from the moneſtarie of the riuer, became very ſorowfull in his heart, with the leauing of the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> for that the fire which inflamed him after he had knowen hir, was gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then the affection which he bare to hir before by the hearing of hir beautie, &amp; that which cauſed his moſt gréefe, was, that he knew not how, either to returne ſpéedely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir, or to ſalue that ſore which he had alreadie chafed.</p>
               <p>He thought in himſelfe, that if he made peace with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King <hi>Tiberio</hi> letting him vnderſtand of the matter, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king wold not accept of it, either for the great enmitie which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, or for the bond wherein he was bound to the Prince of great <hi>Britaine.</hi> And therfore it would be a thing neither reaſonable, nor agréeble with his honour, in lieu of the Princes paines which he had taken, to come from his countrie accompanied with ſo great a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of knights to ſerue him, and in regard of the death which he ther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his ſeruice, now to become a friend to his foe, &amp; to giue his daughter before eſpouſed to the Prince, vnto the deadlieſt foe which the Prince had, debating theſe and other things in his minde about the time that they hadde got ouer their heads the thicke woode wherein they hadde bene before, nowe to the ende not to tyre their horſes, they lyghted downe, vnbrideled their horſes, and tourned them to graſſe. They themſelues féeding on ſuch victuals as they had brought with them, although the meate whereon the Emperours ſtomacke tired, was moſt of all ſobs &amp; ſighes, as receiuing no pleſure in the abſence of the princes. Now the night aſſailed them, and hauing not in them to make reſiſtaunce, they yelded their forces, euerie one taking his reſt where it liked them beſt. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor ſomwhat a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13855:17"/>part from the reſt, caſting himſelfe vpon the gréene graſſe, &amp; ſtaieng his backe againſt a trée, he there remained more then two houres broad awake, ſtaring at the cléereneſſe of the aire, &amp; the brightneſſe of the ſtars, when his thoughtes renued, and the amorous paſſion, if before not cleane buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, now reuiued a freſh by the ſolitarineſſe of his conceit: at length his cares, the wearineſſe of his way, &amp; the ſwéet noiſe of the pleaſant leaues, through the hiſſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wind, brought him to a gentle ſlumber, wherein he had ſcarcely bene halfe an houre, but that his fancie preſented to him againe his Lady <hi>Briana.</hi> He dreamed that ſhe was taken by force of two giants, the moſt fierce and ſtrong that euer he had ſéene in all his lyfe, and that ſhée ſéeing him, cryed for help: Through the griefe wherof he awaked very much afrighted, and indéede this dreame prooued no game vnto him, for by &amp; by he heard a great noiſe néere vnto him, and liſtning where it might be, he beheld a faire chariot draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with foure horſes, &amp; in the top of it two great burning torches ſet in ſiluer candleſticks, by the light wherof he ſaw a Lady in the chariot clothed with rich &amp; princely roabes, and reſembling ſo much the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> that he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beléeued it was ſhe. The gentlewoman leaning on her elbow, and caſting downe her countenaunce, paſſed on ſtill ſighing, as one enduring ſome great force &amp; torment. The Emperour prieng about to ſée who were the guides of the chariot, perceiued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe was carried awaie by two ſtrong and huge Gyants, with great battell axes in their hands, being on foote at the fore ende of the chariot. Theſe two had ſo fell and cruell lookes, that they would haue daunted the courage of any man which ſhould haue beholde them. But the Emperour aſſured in his thought that this was the Princeſſe, with great anger ſtart vp, and not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring to call anie of his knights, with his ſwoord he paced towards the Gyaunts, where without either good euen or good morrowe, he lent the firſt whome he approched vnto ſuch a ſtroke, that the Gyaunt woulde haue morgaged his
<pb facs="tcp:13855:18"/>part in the Ladie to haue made ſufficient paiment of that blowe, for lifting vp his battell axe to receiue the blowe, the ſwoord cut it into the middeſt of the helme, and from thence gliding downe vpon his armour, hewed it into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny péeces. Then the other giant haſtning to ſmite the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, layde at his head with maine force: but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour warded it on his ſhéelde, in which the Gyants bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell axe ſtacke ſo faſt, that he might no more drawe it out, vntill the Emperour ſtrake him on the right arme, that hée made him forgoe his holde. The two Gyauntes thus being left weaponleſſe, with much lightneſſe, more then was likely for theyr bigneſſe, leapt into the Chariot, whereby the Emperour had no time to beſtowe another blowe on them. Then a dwarfe beeing in the one ende of the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, laſht foorth the horſes, ſo that they ranne with ſuch ſwiftneſſe, as if they had fline. With this noiſe the knights awaked, and with their ſwoordes in their hands came to learne what it ſhould bée, in the ende much abaſhed to ſée their Lord in ſuch a heat, as they demaunded of him what befell, hée was ſo troubled in his heart, the Princeſſe thus béeing lead away, that he made them no aunſwere, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his horſe, he commaunded them to followe him. The Emperour ſpurred his horſe with ſuch furie that he made him to runne as faſt, as the Swallowe flieth in the aire. It could not be that the palfraies which drew the chariot were horſes, becauſe his horſe was one of the beſt &amp; moſt precious in the world, &amp; this Lord hauing deſire to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Princeſſe, made him gallop more then an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pace, but the other were ſprightes of the ayre, and infernall furies I thinke, forced by Arte Magicke both to flye and runne. Yet the Emperour followed the chaſe, without looſing the ſight of them, although it was all in vaine. The knightes which remained in the woode, béeing loth to be farre behinde theyr Lorde, went to catche theyr horſes, but were it that naturally they feared the Gyants, or that the wicked ſpirites had bewitched them, they all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13855:18"/>brake out of the place, and ſtrayed héere and there, ſo that the knightes ſpent more then two houres, ere they might take them. By this the Emperour was ſo farre from his knightes with the haſt he made, that they knew not what way to take, and indéede it was not poſſible for them to get within the ſight of him, albeit they had helde on the beaten way, which they thought that the Emperour had taken. They rode one way, and the Emperour belyke poſted another way, for they neuer met, but the Emperour purſued ſo long, vntill in the ende he came to the brinke of the riuer <hi>Danubia,</hi> there where it diuideth it ſelfe into fiue armes, at the ſhoare whereof there was a goodly and tall ſhippe, as the Emperour might well ſée, béeing a bowe ſhot behind the giants. In this they put the chariot &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hoiſed theyr ſailes, and through the middle arme ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with good ſpéede. Thus outraged the Emperour ſo, that with ſpurring he cauſed his horſe to fall downe dead vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. Béeing thus left on foote, notwithſtanding hée diſpayred not, but helde on to that place from whence the Chariot was taken, where he carefully lookt about him to ſee if peraduenture on the one ſide or on the other, hée might trace out a waye to followe: ſo loath hée was to looſe the ſight of it. But as all this was deuiſed by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment, ſo lykewiſe it happened him to ſée a lyttle Shippe ſayling in the riuer with greate ſwiftneſſe: in the which there ſate an olde man with a white beard, by his countenaunce ſéeming to bée a verie honeſt man. To him the Emperour called with a lowde voyce, deſiring him to take towardes the ſhoare. The olde man which had the ſame thing in charge, incontinentlye ſtéered towardes him, and aſked what hée woulde haue. <q>That which I would haue, quoth the Emperour, is to be conuaied in thy ſhippe, to that other ſhip which rideth before vs. For they haue in it ſtollen from me the thing which I loue beſt in all the worlde. This paines if thou wilt take for mée, I will ſo well content thée, as thou ſhall thinke thy
<pb facs="tcp:13855:19"/>trauaile well imploied. Aſſuredly ſaide the olde man, I am content to doe it, becauſe your courteſie induceth me to a greater hope of your merit.</q> Sailing this, he guided his ſhip ſo néere the ſhore, that the Emperour leaped vp into it, and being on the hatches, tourning himſelfe to the olde man to giue him thanks, the old man vaniſhed away: and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour neuer ſaw him after. The ſhip kept the ſame courſe that it began with, and the Emperour was much aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, the rather for that he wiſt no man elſe aboord to rule the ſhip, not knowing what elſe to ſay or think of this great wonder, he then beſéeched God ſo direct his voyage that he might yet obteine his lady: for he verily déemed her to be <hi>Briana</hi> which was in the chariot. In this order being ſtill within ſight of the former ſhip, &amp; not ſtraieng from the way which he had kept, the Emperour ſailed thrée dayes &amp; thrée nightes in the riuer without any lacke of ſufficient foode. By reaſon of this trauaile and thought, the meate which he eate was no more then would ſuffice nature. In the fourth day by morning, the ſhip with the chariot was driuen into the great and large Sea called <hi>Pontus Euxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> through the which he yet ſailed within the viewe of the other, vntill the forward ſhippe arriued in a fayre and delectable Ilande, where the Chariot tooke landing. Halfe an houre after the Emperours ſhippe ruſhed on the ſhoare, with ſuch force that the ſhippe rent in péeces, and with the violence of the ruſh threwe the Emperour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the banke flatlings on his backe, where after hée had ſtretched himſelfe, he began againe to trauaile on foote that way which hée geſſed the Chariot had gone.

But yet of all theſe the noble Emperour tooke no care, for the thought of his Lady detained from him, but onely he beat all both know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and vnknowen wayes, to finde out that wherein the Chariot had gone. At length he winded one, but an vnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed waie, which by all likelihoode was the ſame which hée would haue, in that the graſſe ſéemed new preſſed downe. This tract the noble Emperour followed on foote, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that either the heauineſſe of his armour, or the length of the way, made him to reſt anye whit. From the morning a-full halfe day the Emperour had continued his iourney, not méeting anie perſon, at whome he might aſke newes, of that which hée moſt deſired. But afterwards leauing the thicke and pleaſaunt woode, hee came into a faire gréene or medow full of roſes, and other ſwéete hearbes &amp; flowers of all coulours, without anie other ſhade in all the medow then thoſe trées, which ſerued for an hedge vnto it. The length of this medowe ſeemed thrée bowe ſhotte vnto the middeſt, where was ſcituated a good Caſtle, and in good proportion. It was foure ſquare, hauing at each corner a tower, and on euerie ſide one in the middeſt of the ſide, all
<pb facs="tcp:13855:20"/>of them ſo high as if they ſhould haus edged with the clouds. This great caſtle was incloſed and ſhut in with a high &amp; thicke wall, the ſiones whereof and the towres, did ſhine like Chriſtall, or the well poliſhed ſtéele againſt the Sunne beames. Round about the wall there was a déepe moat, the water being ſo broad, as a man might ſcarce caſt a ſtoue from the one ſide to the other. Ouer the water ther was a bridge, verie large and well towred ſo ſtrong accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the depth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, that it might haue withſtood a thouſand men Thrée towres it had in all, one in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce, another in the middle, and the third at the furtheſt end each of them verie high and great, and wrought with the ſame ſtone, that the great caſtle was builded with. The two vttermoſt towres of the bridge, as well the entry as that towards the caſtle, were gated and barred with dores &amp; locks of fine filed ſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ele, béeing ſo ſhéene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſerued for a looking glaſſe vnto the paſſengers. The locks were ſo ſhut, that vnleſſe they were opened on the in-ſide, it was vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to vndoe them. The good Emperour ſcanned vpon all this, the like whereof he had not ſéene in all his life, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding fully, that no ſuch building might be made by mans hand, yet he meruailed that of an Iland ſo faire and delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, there was no more noiſe bruted, eſpecially ſtanding as it ſéemed to him in a ſea ſo ſaileable. He beléeued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Princeſſe was within, becauſe there appeared to him no other building in all the Iland, and therefore taking wide ſteps, he paſſed on towards the gate of ſtéele, where finding it cloſed, he tooke a great hammer hanging thereby &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the gate with ſuch force vpon the ſounding Stéele, that the furie of the rap was heard through all the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a great part of the Iland. For all this ſtone ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelues to make him aunſwere, although hée had ſtoods more then a whole houre calling and knocking, at length with ſome trouble he departed from thence to coaſt the water, if perchaunce he might light vppon anie other way into the Caſtle. When he had gone a turne about, at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13855:20"/>one part of the wall he happened vpon at Gentlewoman, which was in a little boate newly taking lande at a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne doore of yron, when the Gentlewoman had taken foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the land, ſhe opened the gates making ſhew as if ſhe would haue entered leauing the veſſell in the water. The Emperour ſtrained his voyce to call vnto her y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe ſhould ſtay, but the ſeining as though ſhe heard him not, made to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicket, whereas ſhe was to faſten the doore: the Emperour cryed yet lowder, then ſhe turned toward him, and as though ſhe had but then eſpyed him, ſhe ſayd vnto him. What woulde you haue fir knight? The Emperour prayed her to come néerer, for that he would onely demand a certeine thing of her with this ſhée tooke her boat again and with a little ower rowed toward the land, where the Emperour was, when ſhe came ſomewhat néere the banke there ſtaieng, ſhe ſaid vnto him. What is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you woulde haue ſir knight, in that you haue called me ſo lowde. <q>That which I would faire Gentlewoman anſwered the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is, that you would ferrie me ouer in your boate vnto the Caſtle, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue to do with one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyants which are within. If you haue to deale with them ſaid the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, they be no people on whom you may winne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. That is true ſayd the Emperour, I haue no deſire to trouble them, if they will doe that which I require them. Sith it is ſo ſaid the gentlewoman, I will do your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, becauſe you looke like a knight worthy of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. I giue you great thanks for your curteſie anſwered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emporour, &amp; with this he entred the boat, &amp; ſhouing with the rudder towards the caſtle, he got thether.</q> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman went in leading y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour with her, &amp; cloſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doore after her, conducting him through a little court into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother priuy dore, which was not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon entry. She o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a wicket with ako<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> which ſhe had at her girdle, and brought him farther into a garden, the moſt delight ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> art might deuiſe. The Emperour nowe tooke himſelfe to be in a terreſtriall Paradiſe, and gaſing a while theron,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:21"/>without remembring the occaſion of his thether comming, he was ſo eſtranged from himſelf. Out of this garden by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother doore, they came into a large court of the caſtle, built with bright Alabaſter, the excellencie wherof in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> imagery &amp; workmanſhip ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be declared. For in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of this inchanted caſtle, either the ſumptuous building of <hi>Manſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> tombe, or the famous Pyramides of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maze of <hi>Daedalus</hi> making, found in <hi>Crete,</hi> may wel be forgotten. And as the Emperour muſed on all this, the gentlewoman knowing him to be diſtraught, caught him by the hand, &amp; brought him to a paire of ſtayers, the ſteps whereof were all of Iaſper, by them he mounted with her into a chamber foure ſquare, of the largeneſſe of a ſtones caſt. In this yet ſhe opened another dore, with thrée ſteps of ſiluer plate, out of the gold-ſmiths ſhop, through which ſhe brought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror into a more ſtately chamber, foure ſquare as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other was, &amp; very rich, whereof the ſéeling &amp; roofe were ingrauen gold &amp; emboſſed with many precious ſtones, ſending foorth ſuch a light as it was meruailous. The Emperour tooke no kéepe of the riches of the place, but of the beautie of a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of faire gentlewomen whom he ſawe ſitting richly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in euery part of the chamber, among theſe one ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the principall, ſtalled in a ſeat higher then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; paſſing them all ſo well in beautie as rich apparell. She, as ladie and miſtres aboue them all, held in her hand a Lute, whereon ſhe played and ſung together with ſuch an harmonie, that it was no leſſe daungerous vnto the poore Emperour, then the alluring ſong of the Mermaides ſhould haue bene vnto <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> companie. She ſang ſwéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhe with all reached her warbling notes ſo high &amp; ſo ſhrill, that it much pleaſed the Emperour. Her faire and golden haire hung downe her backe, and couered both her ſhoulders. And you muſt pardon the Emperour if by this he was wholy poſſeſſed with her loue, and forgot his late wife the Princeſſe <hi>Briana.</hi> The enterteinment was great, and yet this chaunge procéeded not through ſhe beautie of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13855:21"/>the enchauntreſſe, for his owne wife was much fairer, but rather by the ſecret vertue of the place, which was thereto deuiſed, according as ſhall be recited héereafter. By this time the Emperour had cleane loſt the remembraunce of his wife, his Empire, Countrey, and what els pertained to him, onely reioycing in the loue of <hi>Lindaraza,</hi> (for ſo this Ladie was called) this he eſtéemed for his principall happe and good fortune. When the Emperour had ſtoode ſtone ſtill a while, this Ladie roſe from hir ſeate, and laieng downe hir Lute which ſhe helde in hir hande, with hir Gentlewomen waiting on hir, and with a good grace ſhée made towards the Emperour to take him by the hande, ſaieng vnto him: You are welcome moſt noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> for whoſe comming I haue long time wiſhed. The Emperour glad of ſuch a welcome, and making not ſtraunge of his courteſie, albeit he coulde not finde whereby ſhe ſhoulde knowe his name, he aunſwered hir. <q>Madame, my arriuall cannot be but good, ſith by it, I may beholde the pricke and price of all the beautie in the world, conſpiring as it were in your excellencie, &amp; ſith you receiue me with ſuch fauour, I beſéech you tell me who you are, leaſt by not knowing you, I might foreſlowe that dutie which I owe vnto your perſon. This account (reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lady) ſhall be made in better time. Now knowe you, that I am all yours, and there ſhall not be done by me or my Gentlewomen other thing, but to doo you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in my Pallaice.</q> The Emperour was intrapped with hir pleaſant ſpeach, and knew not whether he were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or in the earth, and willing to kiſſe hir hande, for the grace ſhe ſhewed him, ſhe thought no ſcorne of a kiſſe on hir chéeke when it was profered. Then ſhe led him by the hand, vnto the place where hir owne throne was, there the Emperor felt in himſelfe a great contentment, by the tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of hir white and delicate hands, imagining with him ſelfe, that he was tranſferred into a ſecond heauen. Some of the Ladies helped to vnarme him, and other were not
<pb facs="tcp:13855:22"/>idle, either plaieng on their harpes, or ſinging and making ſuch muſick, as well eaſed the mindes of the enamoured: ſome brought rich robes to attire the Emperour withall, other, conſerues and comfets very comfortable, with dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate wine in great plates and cups of gold to refreſh him, as he had néede, by reaſon of the trauaile he had taken on foote, although other meate liked him better, which was the ſight of the faire <hi>Lindaraza</hi> and hir company, and ſhée no leſſe enamored with him, behelde him goodly, and with hir knife in one hand, &amp; a napkin in the other, ſhe hir ſelfe carued vnto him of thoſe pleſant conſerues. I doo not think that the Emperour refrained vpon ſtrangeneſſe, but ſhe to quicken his ſtomacke with many a pleaſant deuiſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amorous perſwaſions made him eate a good, and very ſwoote were thoſe morſells vnto him. When this collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ended, with ſome ſolempnitie, the faire <hi>Lindaraza</hi> led him aſide into a great bay window, opening vppon the freſh and gladſome gardein through which the Emperour, with the Gentlewomen had before paſſed. Ther they both beguyled the time with pleaſant ſpeach and melody which the Ladies made in a freſh arbour vpon the top of two trées, the Laurell and the Cipres, the Tenor being main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among them, onely by Nightingales. I denie not, but the ſauour alſo of the ſwéete ſmelling flowers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing their ſpirits, did encreaſe their appetites, and gaue hope of better ioye to come. When it was time to ſuppe, the tables being ſpred, they were ſerued of exquiſite dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Supper being done, the two eſtates fell to their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diſcourſes. It was now night, and yet there néeded nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther torch nor candle, the brightneſſe of the ſtones encha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the walls, made the chambers as light as the daye, when it was time to ſléepe, the faire Princeſſe <hi>Lindaraza</hi> brought the Emperour to hir owne lodging, richly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſilke and golde, wherein was a rich and ſtatelye bed, and ther vnclothed by hir Gentlewomen both of them went to bed, and remaining thus, both of them reioyced of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13855:22"/>their loues to their contentations. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor had thus liued wantonly many dayes, depriued of his vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſauing onely in honouring hir which was before him. In the ende, the beautifull <hi>Lindaraza</hi> was great with childe, and bare him a daughter of rare beautie called <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daraza</hi> by hir mothers name, from whom iſſued a great &amp; noble race, which becauſe in his place it ſhall be largelye declared, I ſhall ouerpaſſe now, briefly touching ſuch occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as I read of in the meane time.</p>

               <p>WHen the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> was in his queſt of the inchaunted chariot, the ſtorie telleth that his knights might not come néere him, ſome becauſe they could not take their horſes, and ſome becauſe his horſe ran ſo faſt, for hée ouercame in halfe a dayes iourney, the trauayle of eyght dayes (as I thinke) for that he was caried both by his own deſire, &amp; the diuels driuing, otherwiſe it had bene impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue endured ſo great paines. For this cauſe I ſay, although the Knightes rode ſo faſt as they might, yet they could not come within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of him, nor find which way he was gone, yet with ſorrow &amp; griefe, eſpeciallye through the feare which they conceiued by his meddeling with the Giants, they parted companies, euery man taking a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way to ſéeke the Emperour, &amp; they agréed at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths end to méete at one place. The month came, when as yet none of them heard any newes of him, although they ſought him in diuers parts. They all meruailed, but not knowing what to ſay, in the ende, they determined at ſome other time to méete, &amp; to enter into this queſt againe. For this time they altogether tooke towards the campe, which they left before the citie of <hi>Belgrado,</hi> where they abode not long, but remembring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of their promiſe, they met at the place appointed, &amp; deuided themſelues accordingly.
<pb facs="tcp:13855:23"/>The foure <hi>Hungarian</hi> knights, fearing to be deſcryed by thoſe which went to ſéeke Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the couertlyeſt which they might, they went toward the campe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and there remained ſome time, after they followed into <hi>Greece,</hi> where they tarried till the returne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, according as ſhall be mentioned héereafter. Now by this time, with no leſſe care and diligence, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was ſought by manie Knights in all the kingdome, for that the King had giuen him no longer time to remayne in the Moneſtary of the riuer then thrée daies. There was already told xx. daies when he came not. Firſt then he ſent many of his knights to knowe the cauſe of his tarrieng, theſe returned vnto the king with an aunſwere that they neither found him in the Minſter, nor could beare tidings of him by the waye. Then the King diſpatched other meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to enquire after him &amp; his knights in all the land, but they brought the like anſwere, yet againe he ſent more then <hi>1000.</hi> well prepared for warre, with authoritie of ſearch through all his kingdome, that they might bring newes of life or death, but all was one. Laſt of all, fearing leaſt peraduenture he had bene taken priſoner by his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he wrote vnto the Emperours campe to knowe the truth, to the end he might raunſome him if ſo it were, but not hearing anie newes, he then bewailed the loſſe of the prince, &amp; became very ſorrowfull, like as contrary wiſe the Emperials bemoned their Emperour. Theſe things happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo in the necke one of another, that <hi>Tiberios</hi> iudgment failed to decide the truth, and he pittied him with no leſſe griefe then if he had bene his owne ſonne, partly for his daughters ſake, who muſt néeds be partner of hir huſbands miſaduenture, &amp; partly for the Princes parents, who could not without ſome ſorow conceiue of his miſſing, albeit all this happened more by the miſgiuing of his owne minde, then by anie certaintie he found. You haue heard particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the care of the king <hi>Tiberio,</hi> now you muſt conſider of the diligence of the king of <hi>Boheme</hi> by the ſemblable.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13855:23"/>Another month had end, and the knights botaries ſped them homewards to the campe of the Emperour, without anye newes of their Lord, which no doubt much moleſted the whole hoaſt, but in eſpeciall it afflicted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Boheme,</hi> to ſée them come without him. As they made declaration of the whole months trauaile, it little pleaſed the king, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the loue he bare to the Emperour, and the want of his preſence in a time ſo daungerous, he wept as ſore for him, as if he had ſéene his little childe giue vp the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The loſſe of the Emperour thus publiſhed through the armie, there was no one which ſorrowed not inwardlye, for he had the loue of all his ſubiects. Albeit, this was boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, yet his loue beguiled him, for the king yet charged more then <hi>2000.</hi> knights with the ſearch of the Emperor in all places, as well by ſea as by land, but it naught auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for the Ilande of <hi>Lindaraza</hi> helde him ſo ſure, that hée could not be found, and if he had bene found, yet he was ſo well garded, that the whole hoaſt had not ben able to haue deliuered him from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inchanted caſtle.

               <p>GReat was the diligence, which the King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> commaunded his Knightes to make, in ſéeking the

But greater muſt néedes be and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible, the mortall dalour which the Princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> conceiued, when ſhe once heard of the miſſe of Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> And as I read, at the thrée moneths ende, when nothing was reported, for very anguiſh of heart, (beſides hir often ſowndings) after, when the recouered out of that traunce, ſhe ſeemed to them néerer the death, then the Prince hir huſband was, as they thought: for beléeuing that he was dead, ſhe woulde neither eate, drinke, nor ſléepe, but became weake and feeble, and waſted hir dayes with ſorrowe. She layd a part all hir Princely roabes and precious Iewells, and tired hir ſelfe in courſe mourning wéedes of a widdowe. She kept hir ſelfe in a ſecret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, onely with the comfort of hir Gentlewomen, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not foorth one ſteppe, demeaned rather the life of an Anchreſſe, or religious woman, then of a Princeſſe.

When ſhée felt the fittes of her trauaile, ſhe was ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with theyr comming, and <hi>Clandestria</hi> with her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, enforced theyr dilligence to doe her ſeruice, giuing themſelues to prayer vntill it pleaſed God to manifeſt his works in this noble Princes.</p>
               <p>She bare two ſonnes ſo ſtraunge and rare for beautie, that the Gentlewomen not a little wondered, and yet they were more mooued to ſée the tokens which either of them brought ſeuerally from their mothers wombe. For they marked well how that the firſt borne, had vppon his left ſide a little face figured, ſhining as bright as if it had bene a little Sunne, and how that the other had in the middeſt betwéene his breaſts a white Roſe, faſhioned of ſo perfect making, that it ſéemed to be gathered from ſome arbour of Roſes.</p>
               <p>Before they ſwadled them, they layde the little boyes betwéene the Princeſſes armes, comforting her with that that God had giuen her, two ſo exellent children.

The Princeſſe verie loth to part with her children, badde her do notwithſtanding what ſhe would with them, ſo that ſhe baptiſed them ere they went, for feare they ſhoulde periſh in the way. Let it be ſo madame ſaid <hi>Clandestria,</hi> for you haue ſaid verie well. The nurſe then tooke water, and powring it on their heads, ſhe chriſtned them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God, with other formall words of Baptiſme, as ſhe could beſt doe. <hi>Clandestria</hi> with a very good grace, gaue names to the little boyes, the firſt ſhée named <hi>Caualiero del Febo,</hi> for the figure that ſhe ſawe in his left ſide néere vppon the heart: the younger ſhe called <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> for the Roſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his breaſts.

Nowe yet ſomewhat there was which impaired this contentation, which was the abſence of her children. This ſhée thought to repaire againe by bringing them vp in her owne lodging, and hauing broken it vnto her Gentlewoman <hi>Clandestria,</hi> whome ſhe deſired to finde the meanes for it. <hi>Clandestria</hi> after conference had with her miſtreſſe, one day ſayd vnto her, that ſhe had well foreſéene the meane.

They haue beſides markes on their bodyes ſuch as thoſe which haue ſéene them, cannot tell what to thinke of them. The firſt borne of them hath on his left ſide the forme of a face vorie beautifull, and ſo bright that I dare liken it to the Sunne, which ouerſhaddoweth the earth, and for this cauſe the little boy is called <hi>Eldonzel del Febo.</hi> The other little boy hath betwéene his breaſts a Roſe growing in the fleſh, ſo freſh of hiewe, and ſo perfectlye couloured, that they which ſée him ſaye, he beareth the badge of his mothers bedde, as if hée had bene borne in an arbour: for this token they name him <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> I tell you madame ſo excellent is their beautie that the beſt Painter in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie,</hi> néede no other example to drawe out the Picture of beautie.

               <p>The Princeſſe telling them that ſhe did it more at theyr requeſt, then of her owne good will, ſayde to <hi>Clandestria,</hi> 
                  <q>you were beſt doe this, which your fellowes require you, my lyking you haue, for I my ſelfe woulde gladlye bée a witneſſe of ſo greate a meruaile.</q> 
                  <hi>Clandestria</hi> tooke her leaue of them, haſting towarde the Citie where her ſiſter dwelt, and declared her meſſage for the bringing of the Princes. Her ſiſters huſband was a verye good Gentleman borne, though verie poore, he &amp; his wife made them ready to come before the Princeſſe, with the little Princes, which by this time were of ſome growth, béeing two yeares olde, hauing both goodly lookes, ſtanding as it were vppon a iuſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of grauitie and pleaſaunce. When they were come to the Pallaice, <hi>Clandestria</hi> firſt entered into the lodging of the Princeſſe, being as yet in the companie of her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, there ſhe lead in by the hand the faire and gratious <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> So ſoone as he was ſéene of the Gentlewomen, they beleeued him to be no leſſe then an Angell of heauen, and that wherein <hi>Clandestria</hi> had before inſtructed them, ſhe had nothing deceiued them. The Princeſſe not hauing ſeene her children ſince her firſt bleſſing of them, and now ſéeing the height of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> with his beautie aboue her hope, ſhe made ſuch ioy as might haue well bene diſcerned by her countenance, but her gentlewomen more attentiue of the beautie wherwith God had indued the young <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer,</hi> were not ware of it. <hi>Clandestria</hi> made the little boye bowe his knées to the Princeſſe, and whether it were nature, or the beautie of his Mother, or both, ſo ſoone as he behelde his mother, he lefte the other Gentlewomen. The

The difference only put in this, that the one had more Maieſtie, the other more mirth and delight in his countenance. The Princeſſe hauing <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> in hir armes, when ſhe ſawe hir other ſonne before hir vpon his knées to kiſſe hir hand, with gladneſſe ſhe rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the ground, and with <hi>Roſicleer</hi> in one arme, tooke him on the other, kiſſing him vpon his chéekes, and in déede rather obaieng the loue ſhe bare vnto hir ſonnes, then regarding the feare ſhe was wont to haue for béeing diſcouered, albeit, to ſay the troth, the Princeſſe was of the better hande, for all the good will ſhe ſhewed, hir Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women imagined to procéede of their beautie. And yet to take all ſuſpect away, ſhe could verie wiſely moderate hir paſſions. <hi>Clandestrias</hi> ſiſter the ſuppoſed mother of thoſe children, and hir huſband, by name <hi>Armaran,</hi> kiſſed the Princeſſes hands, where ſhe in token of good liking inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned them as hir ſeruaunts, from thence-foorth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with hir, as their ſiſter <hi>Clandestria</hi> did. On this wiſe the Princes were nouriſhed in their mothers preſence, without that any knew the right parentage whereof they came, and they ſo enticed the Gentlewomen to the lyking of them, that there paſſed not one houre, without playing and dallyaunce with them. This ioye on the
<pb facs="tcp:13855:30"/>Princeſſe part was vnſpeakable, I dare not ſay, able to countermaund hir foreconceiued griefe, but the worſt was, it was not durable. For fortune euer mutable, chaunged hir copie, and became ſo contrary, that the date of hir eaſe being out, there ſuccéeded diſeaſe &amp; miſhap, ſo that hir death ſhould not haue bene halfe ſo yerkſome, as hir life was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous.

She riſing from the place where ſhe was ſet, followed him, and looke him by the hand, laughing a good to ſée the choler where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was, and walking among the trées ſo long with him, that ſhe came to a large and déepe water, running tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a parte of the great orcharde, where hard by were great ſtore of trées, and whether the Princeſſe, becauſe the place was very pleaſant, often reſorted with hir Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen to reioyce hir ſelfe.</p>
               <p>When they were there, the little boye ſeeing the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was deſirous to playe with it. The nourſe, though otherwiſe willing to haue contented him, yet fearing the daunger of the water, went farther to finde ſome ſure place whereby to come vnto the water, and taking a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boate at the banke, which the gardeiner vſed, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Orcharde, put hir ſelfe in it, and the childe with hir. The boye leaning his breaſte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the brimme of the Boate, troubled the water with his handes, and tooke vp ſome to waſh his face,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:31"/>a while after the water béeing calme and plaine, he looked in it againe, and ſéeing his ſhaddowe there, he began to playe with it, and ſtroke it with his hands, now becauſe it would not giue place, but did that which he did, waxing angrie, he prayed his mother to giue him a rod which laye vpon the land to beate the babe withall. It was a good paſtime for hir, to ſée the diſpleaſure which he had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt his owne ſhadow, and leauing him thus, ſhée lept vpon the lande, to reach him the ſticke that he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Being thus on lande, either with the force ſhe put to the ſide of the boate, in aduauncing hir ſelfe out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boat, or els becauſe it was the will of God, that the lyttle boye ſhould then be preſt to trye the hazarde of his conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So it was, that the boate being vntied, it ſhoued from the ſhore, the nourſe not perceiuing it before ſhe turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: then was it more then two yeards from the land, and not hauing whereby to take holde, it bare ſo ſwiftlye downe the ſtreame in a little time, and ſo farre off, that ſhe loſt the ſight of it. When ſhe ſawe the daunger wherein the little childe was, not hauing power to ſuccour it, ſhée rent hir garments, and tore hir haire, and fel to the ground making ſuch mone, that the Princeſſe and hir Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſitting about the Well, heard it, and much abaſhed, roſe from the place to know what the noyſe meant. When they ſawe the pittifull dealings of the nourſe vppon the ground, quickening their pace they gate néere hir, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the cauſe of hir great lamentation, they founde hir ſo ſorrowfull that ſhe coulde not ſpeake to them, but rather the more ſhe was comforted by them, the more ſhe outraged in crieng, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they iudged hir to be diſtraught. So long laſted theſe hir cryes, that the Princeſſe diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, went towards hir, leauing <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with one of hir Gentlewomen. As the Princeſſe came towardes hir, the nourſe knewe hir, and not hauing the boldneſſe to ſhew how it fell out, in reſpect of the griefe the Princeſſe would take for the loſſe of hir ſonne, before the Princeſſe came
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13855:31"/>at hir, ſhe ranne and lept into the water, with full intent to drowne hir ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which ſhe had done, had not hir clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes borne hir vp, and the gardeiner hearing the great out cries ſhe made, waded in the water for hir, and brought hir to land all wet and bloudie with the blowes ſhe gaue hir ſelfe in the face. This cauſed ſuch pitie and compaſſion in the Princeſſe and all hir Gentlewomen, that all aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they abode only to ſee the nourſes demeanour. In the end, at the inſtance of the Princeſſe, ſhe declared how <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel del Febo</hi> was got from hir, for the which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with hir griefe, and eſpecially the Princeſſe benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of all hir ſenſes ſunke to the ground with no more colour and breath, then if ſhe had bene quite dead. The gardeiner entring into another boate there, which ſhe had to fiſh withall, puſhed vp the ſtreame amaine with his oare to ouertake the boate in which <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but all his trauaile was loſt, for either by diuine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or by Arte Magicke, made by a learned man, as ſhall be tolde you héereafter, the boate rode faſter then the violence of the ſtreame might driue it, and in ſhort time it entered into the great ſea, where it followed the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie waues more then an <hi>100,</hi> miles in a ſhort ſpace, ſo that neither the gardeiner nor who els followed them might in any wiſe attaine vnto him or bring newes of him. When the Princeſſe was reuined, and remembred the chaunce of <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> ſhe powred out ſo many ſalte teares, from hir faire eyes, that lyke as out of fountaines or ſprings, water guſheth out abundantly, ſo from hir face, ſtreamed downe floudes of water, iſſuing with ſobbes and ſighes as would haue broke hir heart in a manner, ſuch as commonly the fall of the water maketh from the ſtéepe mountaines. But for that ſhe would not be heard of hir Gentlewomen, ſhée tourned hir ſelfe and went towardes hir lodging, where remaining alone with <hi>Clandestria,</hi> ſhe gaue a freſh onſet to hir former complaynts, on this ſort.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13855:32"/>
               <p>
                  <q>O mightie and ſouereigne Lord, wherefore doth thy highneſſe ſuffer the Princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> to lyue this long, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe doth roll on this life with ſuch ſorrow and care? O Lord, wherefore gaueſt thou me a huſband in this world ſo valiant, ſéeing that ſo ſoone as I had loſt the name of a maiden, thou madeſt me an vnfortunate widdow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gaueſt thou me ſonnes, with ſo ſtraunge tokens at their birth, if with ſo ſodaine miſfortune I ſhall looſe the one of them, why did I reach to ſo great eſtate, in which I muſt liue with ſorow? And why gaueſt thou me beautie, not to enioy it? Alas poore woman that I am, I ſée that each thing enforceth my paine, for Fortune the miſtreſſe of miſhap, deſpitefully throwing downe thoſe on whome ſhée frownes, hath tourned hir back on me, which deſire to liue without the compaſſe of hir whéele. Ah ſilly woman, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I rub out this life, the more my griefe increſeth. When I ſeeke to mollifie my griefe, then my care redoubleth, and one ſorow ſurceaſing, there ſuccéedeth another, as one bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low followeth on the others necke, in the maine ſea. O thou Lord, which haſt created me, take me out of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull worlde, if by death onely the intollerable miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes may take ende which daily awaite me.</q> Theſe, and other wordes ſpake the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> much agréeuing therewith hir Gentlewoman <hi>Clandestria,</hi> who a little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the courſe of hir aunſwere from the platforme of the others complaint, droue with the Princeſſe vnto theſe concluſions. Firſt, that there was hope inough to recouer hir loſſes, the reaſons which lead hir ther vnto were theſe. Albeit, ſaith ſhe, Gods workes be vnſearchable, yet thus bolde may we be with them, not medling with the cauſes to compare the euills together, and then ſurely the whole courſe of worldly things ſufficiently teach vs, that GOD createth not ſuch excellent perſonages but for excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and not as in dumhe ſhewes vppon a ſtage, where the players onely preſent themſelues and paſſe awaye. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſaith ſhe, you are altogether vncertaine of their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13855:32"/>death, and why not in ſo doubtfull a caſe, ſhould hope bée as ready as care, or perhappes you thinke as ſoone happens the worſe as the better, yet the auncient prouerb is, that he which naught hopeth for, ought to deſpaire naught, for hope and miſgiuing, are in the ſame ſubiect. Therefore ſaith ſhe, you may well hope. The ſecond was, that ſhe ſhoulde comfort hir ſelfe in the beautifull <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> who was then in hir kéeping, for ſaith ſhe, he alone ſufficeth to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile all the harmes which haue chaunced you. For I dare warrant, if God preſerue him, that you maye name your ſelfe mother of the beſt knight in the worlde. With theſe and many other goodly counſailes <hi>Clandestria</hi> daily labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Princeſſe to giue ouer hir griefe: but for all this, if God with his mightie hand had not held hir vp, it had gone wrong with hir. For he prouided hir of comfort by a man very wiſe and wel learned in Art Magick, of whom ſhall be made mention in this hiſtory. By him God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that the priſon of the Emperour with other appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunces ſhuld be diſcouered, foreſéeing by the ſigens, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and other naturall operations, that which ſéemeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible vnto vs. Thus the truth is, that this wiſe man knowing the great ſorow and care, wherein the Princeſſe liued, and well perceiuing that vnleſſe ſhe had more ſuccor at his hands, then ſhe had erſt by other, becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which befell héerafter, it ſhuld be impoſſible to maintaine hir life, determined in himſelfe to comfort hir &amp;, ſo one day as ſhe ſate alone very ſorowfull, wéeping with great abundance of teares, néere vnto the well where hir two ſonnes were begotten, he appeared to hir in the ſhape of a Nimph in the cléere and chriſtalline water, with the haire looſe, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the greateſt part of the body, and with a face ſo beautifull, that the princeſſe abaſhed to ſee hir, and in ſome feare, for that ſhe had not ſeene the like before, wold haue fled from thence. But the Nimph called vnto hir, ſaieng.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If thou kneweſt noble princeſſe who I am, &amp; how wel I know thy great thoughts &amp; paſſions, thou wouldſt not flie
<pb facs="tcp:13855:33"/>from me, but rather ſtay and talke with me. Now becauſe the time affoords me no leaſure to tarrie with thée, and to diſcourſe at large all the loyaltie I beare vnto thée, and the deſire I haue to ſerue thée, in a word I pray thée take good courage vnto thee, to ouercome the great aduerſities, which may come, and ere it be long are like to come vnto thee, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhalt be lefte altogether comfortleſſe. I giue thée yet to vnderſtand, that Prince <hi>Edward</hi> is not nowe liuing, and that in the time, wherein thy diſpaire ſhall bee higheſt, thou ſhalt obtaine thy huſband againe, as ſafe and ſound as he departed from thée, and he ſhall acknowledge thy children, and ſhall ioye in their vertues, that the ioy which thou ſhalt haue héereafter, ſhall ſurmount the paine wherein thou remaineſt at this preſent. Aſſure thy ſelfe therefore that as all ſhall come to paſſe which I haue fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tolde thée, ſo were it good to kéepe it in memorie, thereby to ſtrengthen thy courage, the better to reſiſt the mallice of thy aduerſarie Fortune, whoſe whéele, as it is round, &amp; in continuall motion, ſo perſwade thy ſelfe when it is at the loweſt, muſt néedes tourne againe vpwardes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore thée thy damages. Farewell, and hope no more to ſpeake with me, till all be accompliſhed which I haue ſaid.</q> In this ſort preparing the Princeſſe to the conflict with hir aduerſitie, the faire Nimph vaniſhed away, diuing downe into the depth of the well, and the Princeſſe deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon this ſaieng, was as it were beſides hir ſelfe, not fully knowing whether ſhe had heard thoſe words or drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them. For as ſhe vnderſtoode of the one parte, that Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was dead, and of the other, that ſhe ſhould once againe ſée hir huſbande, ſhe was ſo confuſed in hir thought, that ſhe knewe not what to iudge, and ſayd to hir ſelfe, that peraduenture ſhe had miſtaken the Nymph.</p>
               <p>In the ende, reſting vppon the hope which ſhe had made promiſe off, ſhe was ſomewhat comforted, not doubting the accompliſhment. Yet ſhe remained in the Moneſtarie, not willing to goe out of hir lodging, and clothed alwaies
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13855:33"/>in blacke mourning apparell, and delighting in nothing ſo much as in little <hi>Roſicleer. Roſicleer</hi> as he increaſed in yeares, ſo he excéeded alſo in beautie, goodlyneſſe of bodie, &amp; excellent qualities, that a man might well prognoſticate thereby of his valiauncie. But becauſe the hiſtorie ſhall more ſpecially talke of him, I leaue him for this time to his nurſe, there to be inſtructed, till he ſhall be called foorth to greater matters. Now it is time to goe to the ſuccour of <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> his brother, who is all this time vpon the riuer.</p>

               <p>BY the moſt auncient and true recordes of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirians,</hi> it appeareth, that in that time when <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro</hi> predeceſſour of the great Emperour <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> ruled in the Empyre of <hi>Greece:</hi> there gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the Perſians the mightie <hi>Orixerges,</hi> king of <hi>Perſia</hi> &amp; Souldan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for his greate power among the Pagans much renowned and feared. This man after he had liued in great proſperitie, dyed, leauing behinde him thrée ſonnes, the eldeſt king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the ſecond Souldan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the third Lorde of the Crimſon Iland which is in the red Sea, whence alſo it taketh the name, becauſe all the land is dyed with the coulour. This third brother from his youth was verie ſtudious, and giuen aboue all to Aſtrologie, and other vnknowen ſciences. In theſe hée became ſo exquiſite, that ſcarce in his time might anie hée compared vnto him. The greateſt part of his life time, hée dwelt in that Ilande, chooſing that place as moſt conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for his ſtudie. The eldeſt of the thrée brethren, béeing king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> dyed about <hi>40.</hi> yeares after this diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their inheritance, hauing for heire a ſonne of his. <hi>40.</hi> yeares olde called <hi>Florion,</hi> a valiaunt and ſtrong knight, bigge made, and of a goodly ſtatute. This <hi>Florion</hi> béeing
<pb facs="tcp:13855:34"/>a young man but of a great courage, putting in his roome a vizeroy for his kingdome, wandered as a knight arrant through the world to ſéeke aduentures, where he did great and noble déedes of armes. At the ende of thrée yeares, after this his abſence from his Countrie, he ſtroke ouer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Court of the Souldan of <hi>Babylon</hi> his vnckle. Where he remained ſometime verye well welcomed, and beloued of the Souldan, for hée was a good Knight. The Souldan had a little ſonne and a meruailous faire daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe name was called <hi>Beliſea,</hi> of her <hi>Florion</hi> became enamoured, and requiring her to wife of her father, ſhe was graunted him, and the marriage celebrated betwéene them with great ſolempnitie of feaſts and triumphs. While hée was thus within doores ſporting, there was worſe newes abroad: For a mightie Pagan called <hi>Africano,</hi> the braueſt and boldeſt knight that euer was in all the coaſts of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi> had tranſported ouer into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and by his great force in few dayes ſubdued the whole Countrie of <hi>Media,</hi> and two other kingdomes adiacent, belonging to two great Pagan Princes. Theſe thus vanquiſhed, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came tributaries, as ſubiects and vaſſalls. The fame wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was bruted farre and néere, that there were fewe kings in thoſe partes which requeſted not his amitie, for all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him the luſtieſt warriour in the world: and ſooth it is, that in all <hi>Aſia</hi> was neuer borne ſo proude and fierce a Pagan.</p>
               <p>But hée was gaineſayde by him, vnto whoſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefie not onely our liues and liuings, but wée our ſelues ſtande thrall and ſubiect, otherwiſe he had in fewe dayes made himſelfe Lorde of the greateſt part of all <hi>Aſia.</hi> This Pagan was a huge and mightie man, large lymmed, of the bigneſſe of a Gyant, and ſo ſtrong and weightie with all that the ſtrongeſt horſe which was, he coulde make to bow betwéene his legges, any péece of armour how fine ſo euer it were, he would bend and wreath in his handes, as eaſily as if it had béene framed of Waxe. This man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13855:34"/>well knowing his owne forces and eſtate, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that he had gotten, in few dayes determined to inuade the kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to bring that alſo to his ſubiection. Into it he entered, and in a little time he conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many Cities, plaining Townes and Caſtles, all this while the Prince <hi>Florion</hi> béeing in <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Péeres of his kingdome ſent meſſengers vnto him, declaring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ſtate of the Countrie, howe vnable it was to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, without the leauieng of a new armie, &amp; ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine ſuccours.</p>
               <p>Then the Prince aſſembled the royalleſt army that he might in the land of the Souldan, and ſhipped into <hi>Perſia,</hi> there to giue battayle vnto <hi>Africano,</hi> and to puniſh by armes his enimies intruſion. But he reckoned without his hoſt. For he had not rode tenne miles in his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when the mightie <hi>Africano</hi> came and pitched néere with his whole armie, and in the firſt fielde diſcomfited <hi>Florion,</hi> the moſt part of his people béeing ſlaine. The Prince <hi>Florion</hi> haſted into <hi>Babylon,</hi> for euer diſpayring to be reueſted in his ſegniories, and <hi>Africanos</hi> power was ſo great, that he wel knew all the Souldans power to bée of little force to withſtand him. The Souldan receiued him gladde of his eſcape, but yet ſorrie againe for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and diſheriting of his nephewe of ſo noble a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>As they were thus ſorrowfull, within a fewe dayes after came into the Court the third brother <hi>Lyrgandeo,</hi> which as the ſtorie ſaith, inhabited the Crimſon Ilande, at his comming they were much quieted, he bad them be at reſt and not take care for the kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> for that there was among the Chriſtians a childe borne in the happyeſt and moſt fortunate houre that euer Knight had béene borne in, the which by good aduenture ſhoulbe bée brought to thoſe partes, and by his noble valour and vertue, ſhoulde delyuer the Souldan and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe his Daughter from death, or from perpetuall
<pb facs="tcp:13855:35"/>impriſonment, &amp; diſpoſſeſſing the wicked intruder, ſhoulde place the Prince <hi>Florion</hi> in his lawfull enheritaunce, to his owne great glorie and the vtter confuſion of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This done that <hi>Florion</hi> ſhould enioye his kingdome in peace and tranquilitie all his lyfe, vntill then he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them to haue patience, ſith it is not yet ſayth he, when theſe things ſhall happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> was helde for a verie wiſe man, and they all beleeued his ſayeng, for that at other times he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nined of many things which came to paſſe accordinglye: but yet they knew not who that knight might bée, ſo ſtrong as to reſiſt the force of <hi>Africano,</hi> for he was reputed the braueſt and moſt valiant knight of the world, &amp; they were verie deſirous euerie daie to heare of his arriuall in theyr lande. Now not a moneth after this the wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo,</hi> counſailed with the Prince <hi>Florion</hi> in ſecret, willing him immediatly at that houre to take. <hi>20.</hi> knights of the beſt he had in the Court, and himſelfe, and to embarke themſelues in a warre ſhippe, as it were to ſcowre the coaſtes. Where ſailing in the Sea <hi>Mediterraneum,</hi> Fortune ſhoulde bring vnto theyr power two little boyes the moſt beautifull and excellent that euer hée had ſéene, with theſe, ſayth he, you ſhall retourne to <hi>Babylon,</hi> for theſe are the nurſes of your good happe. The Prince gladde to pleaſe his vnckle, choſe out his knightes, and tooke leaue of the Souldan, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and paſſing through <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe, he came to a hauen in <hi>Phrigia,</hi> where he put himſelfe and his mates in a ſhippe well puruaied of victualles, and lately rigged and trimmed for ſome ſuch voyage. In this with a proſperous winde hée ſayled till at the end of twelue dayes mounting on the tilbacke of the ſhippe to looke if perhaps he might beholde the thing, of which the wiſe man had tolde him. It was ſo that hée kenned a farre off a little barke in which the Gentleman of the Sunne was driuing towardes them, and the waues rocking it on euerie ſide. It might be that this boate defended the burthen naturally,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13855:35"/>as onely following the courſe of the waues: But I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beléeue that God which had created him with ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull markes, tooke this care and kéepe of him, vntyll that <hi>Florion</hi> eſpieng the barke comming right towardes him, and the Gentleman in it ſo beautifull and bright as an Angell of heauen, no tongue canne expreſſe the ioy that nowe hée promiſed himſelfe touching the perfourmaunce of that hope which <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> gaue him to repoſſeſſe his kingdome. His conceit alſo as concerning the beautie of <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> was, that ſome one of the celeſtiall Gods had begotten him on ſome faire Ladie héere on the earth, and therefore as to a perſonage, which did participate with the deitie, he bowed himſelfe, honouring and imbracing <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> and vpon his knées thanked his Gods for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> grace they did him, in deliuering into his hands one with whom they themſelues might ioye. The beautifull young gentleman which ſawe him ſo before him embaſed, feared him not a whit, although the armour gliſtered, but with a ioyfull and pleaſaunt countenaunce colled him and claſped his armes about his necke, as if he had knowen him a long time. I doe not thinke that the deſire of ſafetie made him ſo to fawne vpon <hi>Florion,</hi> for they with whom he was earſt acquainted wore no armour. But the Prince <hi>Florion</hi> tooke him vp in his armes, and kiſſed his white and roſeall chéekes as tenderly as if he had bene his owne childe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to eate of the moſt delicate meates which he had then on boord. The little boy which was verie hungrie fed very well, and from that time forth loued the Prince <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> more then any other: as it is naturall in man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe of whom they receiue benefits. When the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Sunne was well ſatiſfied, the Prince <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> entered againe into his owne ſhippe and hoiſed ſaile to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Phrygia</hi> with a good winde.</p>

               <p>THE ſecond day after the Prince <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> had bene thus taken into <hi>Florions</hi> Shippe, they tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about towardes <hi>Phrygia</hi> whence they firſt departed, and eſcried at thrée of the clocke in the morning ryght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſhippe another the talleſt and beautifulleſt ſhip that euer they had ſéene, which the faſter it ſailed, the née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer it approched to their veſſell. For the Pilot directed their courſe ſtraight vpon <hi>Florions</hi> ſhip, and in ſhort ſpace they ioyned togethrr. This ſhip grappeling with the other, by and by a Chiefetaine getting vpon the hatches commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all in the other ſhippe to yéelde as priſoners. Then the ſtrong <hi>Florion</hi> not knowing who they were, tooke a heauy and well ſtéeled battell are, and getting vpon the ſhipboord, made him anſ were on this wiſe. <q>What art thou knight ſo arrogant, which without knowing who we bée, wouldeſt make vs thy priſoners. What may you be ſayd the knight that you can acquite your ſelues from the terrible <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briniano</hi> which commeth in this Shippe, now except you doe this that I commaund you, all the worlde is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make you a way to eſcape his handes. Vntill this daye there was neuer borne a man which hath made lyke effuſion of humane bloud in this Sea. Then faine woulde I ſée this braue knight aunſ wered the Prince <hi>Florion,</hi>
                  </q> and ſcarcely had he ſpoke theſe words, when the diuelliſh rouer armed with a very great and heauie armour, &amp; a battell are of fine ſtéele in his handes, ioyned to the Prince ſpéedely, and without God ſpéede you, layde at him ſuch a blowe vpon the head péece, as might haue clouen his head in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But the Prince was deliuer and quicke, and ſéeing the battell are deſcending, the aire beaten before it, he ſtept aſide, and the blowe fell vpon the planks of the ſhip, which made a great péece therof to fall into the water, quite ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13855:36"/>him from hope of a ſeconde blowe. Then the bolde <hi>Florion</hi> cloſing with him, gaue him a buffet with his ſwoorde vppon his great and fine helmet, that he made him bowe his knées, and with the greate weight of his bodye ſcarcely might this rouer ariſe, but hée tourned himſelfe with greate paine to ſtrike the Prince. There beganne a braue and terrible battaile, either of their knightes much amaſed in beholding them. Now welfare thy heart thou va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Florion,</hi> for thou much diſappointedſt <hi>Mambrinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> of his enterpriſe, &amp; made him confeſſe that in twentie yeares robbing on the Sea of as many ſo he might finde, he had neuer met knight which had put him in ſo greate daunger, nor fought with one of ſo great force. Thus they fought halfe an houre and no man might iudge who ſhould haue the better. The great rouer ſtrake with all his force at his enimie, (but the finall houre of his owne lyfe now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There the wretched <hi>Mambriniano</hi> with his gluttenous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſpit out his ſtinking and corrupted ſpirit, and the noble <hi>Florion</hi> reſted not héere, but with a braue &amp; ſtout courage entered in the ſhip and laid about him on both ſides. The knights of the rouer to reuenge their Lords death woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him on all parts, but by &amp; by there boorded them twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie knights of the Prince, all choſen men of warre, and helped their Lord in ſuch wiſe, that in ſhort time the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt parte of theyr enimyes were ſlaine, and the reſt ſéeing their fall, yeelded themſelues to his mercie. The battayle thus ended, the Prince woulde ſée what was
<pb facs="tcp:13855:37"/>in the ſhip, for he beléeued that there was within great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, according as the dealings of the rouer had ben. There was much treaſure found, but ſearching euery place of it, they founde in a cabbin a knight of an indifferent age clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with rich garmentes, and by his graue countenaunce ſeeming to be of good account, and néere vnto him a young Gentleman of foure or fiue yeres olde, verie beautifull and ſeemely arayed in cloth of golde, and about his necke a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of golde ſet with rich and precious ſtones. The young Gentleman was ſo gracious in behauiour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if <hi>Florion</hi> had not before ſeene the Gentleman of the Sunne, hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued him to be the faireſt and propreſt Gentleman that euer hée had ſéene, and deſiring to knowe who they were, he ſaluted them curteouſlys, willing the knight to tell him who they were. He which had alreadie knowen <hi>Florions</hi> greate vertue in the battaile that hée had with the rouer, roſe with the young Gentleman from the place where hée was ſet, and vſing an humble duetie to him, aunſwered. <q>Sir knight, I am a priſoner to the rouer <hi>Mambriniano,</hi> which tooke me and this young Gentleman at a place néere a hauen of the Sea, and ſith God by Fortune hath béene ſo fauourable vnto you that in a righteous battayle you haue ſlaine him, wée remaine now for yours to doe with vs that which ſhall ſéeme beſt vnto you, and we haue good hope that with a knight of ſo greate valour, there cannot happen vnto vs ſo much euill as with him which tooke vs priſoners.</q> The Prince accepted well that which he ſayde vnto him, and prayed him to goe on in declaring who hée was, for that by lacke of knowledge hée might forſlacke to doe to them the honour that they merited. Albet nowe the knight wiſhed that hée might diſſemble it for the daunger that might enſue, yet in the ende, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his affiaunce in the Prince, he ſayde vnto him. <q>Sith it liketh you ſir knight to know who we be, onely to pleaſe you I will tell it you, though I woulde gladly haue ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed our names, till Fortune ſomewhat more friendly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13855:37"/>vnto vs ſhoulde haue bewrayed it. But knowe you that this young Gentleman is called <hi>Claueryndo,</hi> and is the ſonne of the king <hi>Oristeo,</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> onely inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and ſucceſſour of that great kingdome, and I haue to name <hi>Armineo,</hi> béeing brother to the king <hi>Oristeo,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle to this young Gentleman. The whole order of this miſfortune, was in this ſorte. One daye for to ſporte our ſelues, in the company of many other knights, we rode to a faire forreſt néere vnto the Sea, and the Knights which came with vs, the moſt of them delighting in hunting, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered themſelues for their diſport, in ſuch manner, that the young Gentleman and I, with onely ten knights, wer leſt in a freſh and faire arbour about a well, neere adioyning vnto the Sea. In this time, while our knights followed their game, this great Rouer <hi>Mambriniano,</hi> whether eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng vs, or by chaunce taking land for freſh water, wee knowe not, but with more then twentie knights he beſet vs, and although we defended our ſelues ſome time, in the end, this Gentleman and I were taken priſoners, and our ten knights ſlaine &amp; ſore wounded, before the other knights which hunted in the forreſt might vnderſtande of it. He caried vs to his ſhips, where it is more then a month that we haue bene in this manner as you haue ſéene vs, cloſe pent vp in this cage. For my ſelfe Sir, as I neuer hope for libertie, ſo I reſpect not my impriſonment, but for this faire young Gentleman my heart is ſore wounded. I had rather ſuffer ten deaths, then any ſuch miſfortune ſhoulde happen to him. Becauſe that when ſuch newes ſhall bée reported to his father, he will beare it more impatientlye than his owne, and that which worſt is, to me onely will he attribute this fault, ſith, hauing committed his onely ſonne to my gouernance, I haue giuen ſo ill account of him.</q> Vnto theſe words, the knight lent manie a teare ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe his face, which well ſhewed the griefe he bore in hart. The prince <hi>Florion</hi> in great compaſſion comforted him, promiſing libertie of returne into his country when

This charge I ſuſtained in mine owne perſon a good while, but being young and luſtie, and in good age to follow armes, I was deſirous to wander in the world.

But when they ſawe him naked, and the portraiture of the Sunne, with the brightneſſe that it gaue to the beholders, it was ſo ſtraunge, that they called to minde <hi>Phaetons</hi> fall out of heauen, comparing this young Gentleman with <hi>Phaeton,</hi> as if he had bene <hi>Phoebus</hi> ſonne, like as <hi>Phaeton</hi> was, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſomewhat diuers againe in this, for that <hi>Phaeton</hi> taking his fathers chariot, for his preſumption was dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Sea, this young Gentleman was preſerued in the Sea, as betokening ſome greater ſecrecie in Nature. <hi>Armineo</hi> was beſt apayed to haue the companie of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Gentle man for the Prince <hi>Claueryndo.</hi> Now by the way, this may you learne, that although they could not tell <hi>Donzels</hi> name, yet by the tokens he had vppon him, they named him the Gentleman of the Sunne, ſomewhat in other tearmes in the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue, but in ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all one, with the name that his mothers Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gaue him in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> being worth the marking that both <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> ſhould ſo iumpe in naming him.

                  <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> which was not farre off, gaue him great thanks in the behalfe of the Prince. Then they two rode together deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of many things, and many curteous words of good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinment paſſing betwéene them, vntill the <hi>Souldan</hi> fell in talke with the young <hi>Clauerindo</hi> &amp; <hi>Armineo,</hi> to whome he ſhewed a friendly countenaunce in token of great good loue. Theſe things thus done, they all held on their waye to the Citie, and paſſing through towardes the Pallaice, there they were receiued by <hi>Baliſea</hi> Princeſſe and wife to <hi>Florion,</hi> making ſemblaunce of great liking to <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> whoſe excellent beautie and comelinſſe ſhe well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and already concluded in hir thought for a companion to hir ſonne, now of thrée yeares olde, verie large and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful called <hi>Brandizel.</hi> Which in déed after proued a knight ſo good, as few better, béeing ſtrong made, ſomwhat higher than his father, and of more puiſſance.

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:13855:40"/>
               <p>Theſe young Gentlemen thus brought vp in <hi>Babylon, Armineo</hi> which in all things was verie wiſe &amp; well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, taught <hi>Clauerindo</hi> the liberall arts, and inſtructed him in the true and perfect law of God, in ſuch maner, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his education was among the Pagans, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince was alwaies a good Chriſtian. The wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> like wiſe carefull of the Gentleman of the Sunne, &amp; of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizel</hi> read vnto them diligently what was conuenient, ſaue that as he was a Pagan, ſo he acquainted them only with Paganſie in their religion: which error notwithſtanding afterward they both renounced. This was the training vp of the young Princes in the court of the <hi>Souldan,</hi> as heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked vnto, as if it had bene in their parents Courts. But as their yeares multiplied, ſo they excéeded, all others inferiour in iudgment, wit, diſcretion, goodlines of ſtature, actiuitie, and all that which was requiſite to ſuch princes, but eſpecially and aboue all his equalls, <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> ſurpaſſed. For attaining to the age of ten yeares, he ſéemed to be more then fiftéene, both for wit and ſtrength, courage and pollicie, and by the bigneſſe of his body (being withall well featured) men gathered vndoubtedly of his might.</p>
               <p>They made their argument thus. If he be ſo ſtrongly ſet in his youth at ten yeares, what will he be at twentie. And truely although, his father the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> was big of bodye, as the hiſtorie hath alreadie ſpecified, being eight foote in height, yet <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> ouereached him ſomewhat, and with all this maintained the prerogatiue of his proportion. So that I thinke our painters as well <hi>Grecians</hi> as <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> had neuer the perfect knowledge to drawe and finiſh the true proportion of man, before they had the view of this knight. His picture was ſent into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts, as the nobleſt Painture that ere was wrought. Beſides this, ther appeared in his face a maieſtie ſo graue and Prince like, that it ſtroke a feare of him into migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Princes. For all this, he was yet of behauiour affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſome-what familiar, that hée which knewe
<pb facs="tcp:13855:41"/>him well, albeit his mortall enimie could not but highlye commend of it. What ſhall I ſay? As the Adamant ſtone draweth to it, the harde and ſharpe yron by his hidden vertue, ſo likewiſe this knight procured the loue as well of foes as of friendes, and of as manie as knewe him, and were conuerſaunt with him. And ſo this young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>Claueryndo</hi> and <hi>Brandizel,</hi> and other young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which were his play-fellowes were ſo glad of him, that they could at no time be without him. Now, becauſe we haue more perticularly to deſcend into this ſtory héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and to deſcribe the manifold graces of this knight, for theſe matters we will let them paſſe at this time, and remember you of his age of twelue yeares, at which time, there happened that which ſhall appeare in the chapter fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

Nowe, when the young Gentlemen could ſit their horſes, and were able to endure ſome trauaile, they tooke them with them, and furniſhing them with boare ſpeares in their hands, they appointed them to the chaſe. Some game there was killed before them, wherein they tooke great ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but eſpecially the Gentleman of the Sun, which by himſelfe wearied a wilde Beare &amp; two Bores ſo fierce, as might haue frayed a right good Knight. His practiſe was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it was ſo, that one day the <hi>Souldan</hi> would go to the ſame forreſt to delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there for certaine daies, taking with him the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13855:41"/>
                  <hi>Baliſea</hi> his daughter, and the traine of many Ladyes and Gentlewomen, and the moſt principall Lordes of his Court, becauſe the place was gallaunt and delectable, and repleniſhed with varietie of game, béeing as I ſayde, hard vpon the cliffes of the Sea. For this cauſe there were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp many pauilions there, and there was puruayed of other prouiſion neceſſarie for the houſeholde. Hée made his owne tent to be pitched in a flouriſhing meddow next to a goodly fountaine. There reſted he one day ſolacing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe among his knightes, for the firſt daye they went not out to ſéeke their game. The next daye early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Prince <hi>Florion,</hi> the young Gentlemen, and the moſt part of all the knightes tooke theyr way through the forreſt, climbing vp a ſteepe hill, and parted themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuerſe companyes, ſome to raiſe the game, and others to be at the receipt. The Souldan and the Princeſſe with her Ladyes, and onely <hi>15.</hi> knights remaining in their tents as vnmindefull of any danger if anie ſhould happen. The Sun being almoſt at the higheſt, and his beames more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, the Souldan with the Princeſſe his daughter and her Gentlewomen left their tent &amp; came to the fountaine, the water being cléere, and the place wel ſhadowed with trées, there in the quiet ſhade to abide the comming of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince <hi>Florion</hi> and the young Gentlemen to dinner. In the meane time the Gentlemen ſewers prepared the cupboord and the cookes made ready for dinner. The tables being ſpread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the gréene graſſe, &amp; euery man attentiue to his functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the officers to their charge, the knights to their game, &amp; the Souldan with the Princeſſe &amp; Ladies to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the coole aire: there came in place a mightie &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gyant, with more then twentie knights after him. The Ladyes ſcréeched out, but there was no remedie. For the Gyant with his knights tooke the Souldan, the Princeſſe, and moſt of the Gentlewomen, and conuaied them into a chariot drawne by ſtrong horſes which they brought with them for the ſame purpoſe, with the outcryes of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes

The Gyaunt hauing his praye, withall the haſt he might tooke toward the Sea, where he had a good ſhippe in readyneſſe. The lamentable noyſe which the Ladyes made was ſuch, that it beat through the aire into the ſkies, and yet could not penitrate ſo farre as to Prince <hi>Florion</hi> or his knights, either that they were ſo eager in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purſute of their wilde Boares, that they marked it not, or that the crye of the hunters was ſo lowde that it drowned the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the young Gentleman of the Sunne, looſing his companie, and well mounted vppon a light horſe with a Boare ſpeare in his hand, béeing alſo clothed in a hunters wéed of gréene cloth of gold, &amp; a hat to kéep downe his ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low haires, rode roming about the woode to ſéeke ſome beaſt, vpon whom he might try the ſtéele of his bore ſpeare, and taking this way and that way, without ſtaieng in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye place, he met with a knight ſore wounded by the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, which rode pitteouſly to call the Prince <hi>Florion</hi> and his knights for ſuccour to the Souldan &amp; the Princes. As <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> ſawe him thus araied, he aſked what he ailed. Alas Gentleman of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne, ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, our Lord, and the Princeſſe, are taken priſoners by an vgly &amp; monſtrous gyant, and by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haſt he maketh, I geſſe he is alredie néere vnto the Sea: The Gentleman of the Sunne much lamented ſuch newes, and with a noble and heroicall courage, which by nature nowe enforced it ſelfe forward, he praied the knight to guide him on the waye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant. The knight thinking it an vnfit match &amp; beſide his purpoſe to turne backe with him; for he thought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13855:42"/>him too young for ſuch an enterpriſe, woulde not ſtaye, but rode on faſter. The Gentleman moued with this that the knight ſet ſo little by him, yet ſayd nothing, but not tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng for more companie broched his horſe with his ſpurs, that he made him ſpinne the ſame way in which hée had ſéene the knight before. The haſt he made is incredible, for before the Gyaunt had recouered the Sea, he ouertooke him in a plaine amongeſt his knights, and the Chariot in the middeſt. The Gyaunt was hindmoſt on foote, with a great battell axe of ſtéele in his hand, ſo that it might haue diſmaied one to ſée his fierce and cruell demeanour. When the Gentleman of the Sunne had got a ſight of him, with greater force then before he ſpurred his horſe, making way through the gréene meddowe as faſt as if he had ben dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the rage of tempeſt and thunder, and crieng aloud. Stay, ſtaie. The gyant and his knightes hearing the noiſe that he made and the ſound of the horſe féete galopping in ſuch haſt, turned their heads aſide to ſée what it meant, and amongſt the reſt the Souldan lykewiſe looked behind him, and eſpyeng him to bée the Gentleman of the Sunne with onely a Bore ſpeare in his hand, he much pittied his caſe, for he thought ſurely <hi>Donzel</hi> ſhoulde neuer eſcape death or durance. The loathſome Gyant wondering at the young Gentleman comming toward him, with great furie lifte vp both his handes to his head, and there ſtayeng on foote as he was, made a fierce and ſterne countenance of diſdaine, till the young Gentleman aproched. But the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and valiaunt <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> borne for the atchiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of greater aduentures, with a furious moode as it had ben thunder drew néere, and with his boare ſpeare in his hande, being verie ſtrong, ſharpe, and well ſtéeled, with all his force he ſhoued it into the breaſt of the gyant, that although he had a breaſt plate of fine ſtéele a finger thicke, yet the Speare entered, and iſſued out at the ſhoulder all begored with bloud. Thus the Gyaunt fell downe dead on the grounde, to the greate abaſhment of all thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:13855:43"/>which ſawe him, iudging that <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> had bene then let downe from heauen to doe this feate, for in theyr fancies, not the thunderbolt which by the renting of the Clowdes driueth the windes before it, might euer giue a more ſodeine or more forcible blowe then that which <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> gaue the Gyant, eſpecially the knightes of the Gyants retinue, not witting who he was, imagined that their owne Gods had ſent him downe from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens for the more notable chaſtiſement of theyr Lordes crueltie. Nowe ſome of the knightes hearing a ruſhing a farre off in the woode, and thinking it to be the Souldans people, theyr maiſter thus ſlaine, without hauing care of Chariot or priſoners, tooke them to theyr héeles with more haſt by halfe then good ſpéede. For one letting the Bridle flippe, and for feare not able to guide his horſe, by the ſtumbling of his horſe had ſo ſore a bruſe, that his horſe riſing, he lay ſtill on the ground tormented with the fall. And thoſe which got to the Sea, themſelues beeing paſt daunger, nothing ſorrowed at the death of the Gyaunt, for they hated him, and ſerued more by compulſion, then with good will. This trouble in the Gyauntes men made the Gentleman of the Sunne make no account of them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore alighting from his horſe, hée went towardes the Chariot where the Souldan was, with the Princeſſe and Ladyes, and vnbound them. The Ladyes when they ſaw him, were no leſſe glad of the proofe of armes in <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel del Febo,</hi> then of their owne deliuerie. But the Souldan embraſing him and kiſſing him with great loue, ſayd vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O my ſonne, now I knowe aſſuredly that the mightye Gods highly fauour you, &amp; that onely by miracle you haue ben brought to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as to giue ſuccours to me &amp; to my children. Now doe I firmely beléeue my brother <hi>Lyrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo,</hi> who long before propheſied of the greate meruayles of your valour, ſith that béeing ſo young and tender and in the maidenhead of your ſtrength, it béeing neuer before
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13855:43"/>taſted vpon an enimie, you haue begun ſo well as I haue knowne no knight in his perfection matchable. And truely this is the accompliſhment of your firſt aduenture as my brother foreſéeing it told me, that you ſhould reſcew mée &amp; my daughters from death or impriſonment, and I hope as well in the immortall. Gods that the ſecond ſhall be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe finiſhed, that is, the kingdome of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſe long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by a falſe vſurper, may by you be redeliuered to the Prince <hi>Florion.</hi> My Lord aunſwered <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> I haue not as yet done the thing in your ſeruice neither in my life may hope to compaſſie which may counterpaiſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my good will in this behalfe, and truely the dutie which I owe to your good grace my Lord, to the Prince <hi>Florion,</hi> &amp; to my Lady the Princeſſe your daughter, daily ſo augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, as more then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> duetie I cannot owe vnto my father, to the diſcharge wherof, notwithſtanding I ſtand bounden to your goodneſſe, not onely of curteſie, but in conſcience, &amp; ſo humbled himſelfe before the Souldan: but the Souldan againe embraced him, &amp; they two helped the Ladies out of the chariot.</q> The Ladies were deſirous to knowe who the gyant was, and what ſhuld be the cauſe why he ſo aſſailed them. Therfore the Souldan &amp; the Gentleman of the Sun made toward the knight of the Gyants which was falne to the grounde, and as they tooke of his helmet to giue him ayre, they fetcht him out of his ſounde, and ſetting him on his féete, they demaunded of him who the Gyaunt was, and why he came to take them priſoners. The knight ſéeing it behoued him to ſay the troth, made anſwere ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus. <q>You ſhall vnderſtand my Lordes that this Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was called <hi>Brandafileo,</hi> Lorde of the towred Ilande, which is in the great Ocean, at the mouth of the redde Sea. This Ilande is ſo ſtrong and inuinſible, that béeing within, hée néede not feare all the worlde if they had bent their force againſt him, and béeing proude vpon the ſafetie of this Ilande, he did much wrong to the nations rounde about him, ſpoiling and robbing all <hi>Arabians, Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:44"/>Aegyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Garamantes</hi> of <hi>Inde,</hi> and finally ſo many as he might come by in the great Weſt ſeas, and ſo the Ilande of <hi>Traprobane,</hi> and by long continaunce in this trade of rouing, hée is become ſo rich of captiues and treaſure, that no Iland is comperable with his. Nowe the cauſe wherefore he came into this your land was, for that in the time that the mightie <hi>Orixerges</hi> your father reigned in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the father of the Gyant called <hi>Briontes</hi> then bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lorde of the towred Ilande; by occaſion of <hi>Briontes</hi> euill lyfe, your Father and he fell at variaunce, wherefore the king your Father ſent out his whole nauie to ſubdue this Iland, but being not able to conquere it, he gaue them notwithſtanding in charge to lye in the out créekes awai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when he came forth from the Iland, &amp; ſo to ſet vpon them. One time the Gyant making a road out for a lyke cheuiſance a farre off from his owne Iland, the king your Father dogged him with his ſhippes, and as he returned met him in the halfe turne, and (for all the hauocke he and his made of your fathers ſouldiers) in the ende killed him. This <hi>Brandafileo</hi> his ſonne then being a childe of tender age, yet ſo ſoone as he was of yeares to be made knight, he greatly longed after the reuenge of his fathers death, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not worke his miſchiefe on the king <hi>Orix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erges,</hi> béeing then dead, at the leaſt it would eaſe his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, if he might wreake himſelfe on you his ſonne, and for this cauſe many times hée hath ſent ſpyes into your land, to be aduiſed by them when he might haue opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of vengeance, &amp; learning of your comming to this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for your diſport, he hath now laine more then a month in ſecret expectation of ſo good lucke as to take your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This time he had founde to his contentation, had not this Gentleman ben, who now hath made ſufficient paye to <hi>Brandafileo</hi> for his months hire. This is all my Lorde which I can tell you as to your demaund, and it is truth which I haue tolde you, as I certeinly beléeue, that if euer he had cleane carried you from hence, you ſhould not haue
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13855:44"/>eſcaped from death or bondage, for ſo hée had determined.</q> The Souldan muſed at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the knight had told him, &amp; waieng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great danger wherein he was like to haue falne, he ceaſed not to giue thanks to his Gods, &amp; to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Sun for his ſafety. At this time Prince <hi>Florio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> came with more then. <hi>30.</hi> knights running theyr horſes, ſo faſt as they might, becauſe alreadie they had hearde the newes, &amp; comming wher y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant lay dead, viewing well the wide &amp; mortall wound, they highly commended of it, and ceuld not iudge by whom he had receiued it, but very ioyfull to ſée the Souldan &amp; his Princeſſe out of daunger, leaping from their horſes they came towards them. Then <hi>Florion</hi> excuſing his long abſence by the ignoraunce of the fact, deſired to know who he was which had ſo gently bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them from the Gyaunt. The Souldan aunſwered on this ſort. <q>Ah <hi>Florion, Florion,</hi> now we knowe your vnckle <hi>Lyrgandeos</hi> diuinations, as touching this Gentleman of the Sunne, to be ſooth and ſtedfaſt, for we haue well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his valour, and knowe that he alone béeing the onely man which came to ſuccour vs, brought to ground the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Brandafileo</hi> by one onely blow with his bore ſpeare, riuetting as you ſee his coat armour, and ridding vs from ſo daungerous a foe, making his enteraunce to knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode the ſtraungeſt that euer was heard.</q> 
                  <hi>Florion</hi> giuing backe, either as wondering or not crediting his vnckles ſpeach, was ſtill vrged by the Souldan, who tolde on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as <hi>Brandafileos</hi> knight had confeſſed. <hi>Florion</hi> yet as it were halfe in a mammering which part to take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Gentlemans youth and his courage, diſputed rather the impoſſibilitie by meanes of the hugeneſſe of the Gyant, his ſtrong armour, and the number of his knights, in the end he ouercame himſelfe, by remembrance of <hi>Lyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeos</hi> reporte, and thanked the Gentleman on this wiſe. <q>O my right noble and beloued ſonne, I graunt, that that not my force, but the mightie windes and ſwelling waues by the ordinaunce of my Gods, haue giuen mée
<pb facs="tcp:13855:45"/>power ouer you, for that by your ſouereigne bountye the wrong which is done to me by the tyraunt ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged, and I ſhall recouer mine owne kingdome. O how happie was the daye and the houre fortunate in which I found you, ſith my Gods haue reſerued you for ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefiter towardes me, and the releaſe of mine vnckle, with theſe and many other words <hi>Florion</hi> wept for great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to thinke of <hi>Donzels</hi> magnanimitie.</q> And in this time the other young Gentlemen his companions came ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from hunting, and ſawe the fierce Gyaunt lye dead by the waye, they enquired after the manner of his death, and hearing it to be as you haue heard, the one tooke great pleaſure in it, and the other with an honeſt emulation of the fact, wiſhing it to himſelfe, according to the diuerſitie of the good will they bare vnto the Gentleman of the Sunne. Then they came altogether to theyr tentes, where they made but a hunters breakfaſt, for ere dinner was halfe done, the Souldan commaunded the horſe to retourne to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo they all on horſebacke, the Princeſſe and her Gentlewomen on their palfraies, and the luſty knights on their ſturdie Rounceualls tooke the way towardes the citie, laieng the mightie Gyant vpon a horſe, his head and féete trailing on the ground.</p>
               <p>When they were within the gates of the Citie, all that which had happened beeing publiſhed, all the Citizens and other of the court were in contrarie arguments about the hugeneſſe of the Gyant and the courage of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Sunne, thinking it an vnpoſſible matter to be brought about by one of ſo fewe yeares. But from that time forth, (although before likewiſe they loued him) yet now they made much more of him, and the Souldan with the Princeſſe and all the Courtiers held him in great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count alwaye. Notwithſtanding the report of men, and the high extolling of his actes to his owne face, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Sunne kept the ſame tenour of life, not bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe anie thing vpon his good fortune, but rather
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13855:45"/>as the windes increaſed, which promiſed him ſafetie and honour, and as his fame was more blazed, ſo he ſtroke his ſayles and became more lowlyer. This his humilitie made him much more to be loued, as the ſprinkelyng of water, augmenteth the flame in a Smithes forge. <hi>Claueryndo,</hi> at this time egged on by <hi>Donzels</hi> good happe, and béeing of riper yeares, ſued to be made Knight. But the wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> fore-ſéeing ſome-what, and to haue him keepe company with <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> and <hi>Brandizel,</hi> with-ſtoode his purpoſe for that time. <hi>Claueryndo</hi> was but about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene or fifteene yeares of age, but he was ſo comelye and nimble in all feates of armes, that there was not a knight in all the court which out-paſſed him. In this maner were theſe two Gentlemen brought vp in the <hi>Souldans</hi> Court, with great magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as if they had ben in their fathers courts, &amp; aboue all, they wer ſo throughly inſtructed in ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that ther wer none able to come in controuerſie with them, all this, equall to both, notwithſtanding the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of beléefes, which ſhall be a lyke ere it be long. <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryndo</hi> which was guyded by <hi>Armineo</hi> his vnckle, was a Chriſtian: and the Gentleman of the Sunne beléeued in the lawe of the Gentiles, as the wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> hadde taught him, <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> himſelfe, being bred and brought vp in the ſame errour by his father, for all his great cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was not able to finde out, the vanitie of his falſe Gods.</p>
               <p>O the prouidence of God, how much be we bounde to thée, and how ill doo we acknowledge thy great goodneſſe, in ſuffering vs to be become Chriſtians, when thouſandes wiſe men and mightie Monarchs dye in the lawe of the Gentiles, not all their power auailable to ſaue their ſoules, &amp; their learning not worth a ruſh for the diſplaieng of the falſhood of that lawe, wherein their fathers haue nouſeled them. And ſhall we Chriſtians think that our knowledge can pull vs out of hell, if not the wiſeſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, I meane the learned Gentiles, could once reproue their owne law,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:46"/>and knowe the onely and true God. As for example, this <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> was ſo wiſe and well learned, that not <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medoro,</hi> nor <hi>Rogel,</hi> nor Turke, nor Saraſin, nor Iew, nor Chriſtian came euer néere him, and yet becauſe he had ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that lawe from his cradle, and wanted the gifte of God, for the true vnderſtanding of his will, he wallowed ſtill in his errour, as the Sowe doth in the myre, till God hauing a regard of the Gentleman of the Sunne, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make him a true Chriſtian, did by his meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> to the knowledge of his will, and poure out his grace abundantly vpon the whole kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> according as more largely ſhall be recited. But to returne, the two young Gentlemen, albeit contrary in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, yet in friendſhip and good will were conformable, as ſhall be declared in this ſtorie.</p>

This Lady was led, by a knight great of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, well and ſtrongly proportioned, &amp; armed at all points, with a rich and ſtrong armour. This knight lifting vp the viſor of his helmet, ſhewed himſelfe to the Souldan, where they perceiued his face to be very foule and fearfull, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour more tawnie and Sun-burnt, then cole-blacke, his eyes flaming in his head, his noſtrells wide and large, broad lipped, and his ſharp fangs iſſuing out of his mouth, like Boares tuſkes, and reaching to his chin, ſo that there was no man liuing, but might haue bene afrayed of his fierce ſemblance. But beſides this, he was ſo high, that there was not any in that place, whom this knight exceeded not two ſpanfulls at the leaſt, and in making of his bodye, hée was ſo large and well quartered, more then the compaſſe of two knights. Hauing thus entered and ſet himſelfe to view, thoſe which wer preſent, had inough to occupie their eyes, either on the vglineſſe of the Gyant, or the beautie of the Gentlewoman. But the Gentlewoman knéeled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Souldan,</hi> to haue kiſſed his handes.

<pb facs="tcp:13855:47"/>ſelfe cruell and aduerſe to me, that ſhe onely not ſufficed with the death which my father and mother, and many of their ſubiectes haue receiued for my ſake, ſhe ceaſeth not daily to afflict me, and to bring me to ſo low an ebbe, that being defeated of mine owne inheritaunce, I am yet faine to wander through the Courts of mightie Princes to find ſome good and pitifull knight, which bewayling my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, will eaſe me of the great trauaile I daily take to ſaue my honour. For if you wil ſuffer me to lay open my caſe, the whole ſtorie is thus. I am right enheretrix of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of <hi>Cypres,</hi> where my predeceſſors reigned long time with much ioy, vntill that their good hap was hindred by my beautie. For hauing brought me into this world, with that beautie wherein you ſée me, which I woulde to our that beautie wherein you ſée me, which I woulde to our Gods had either periſhed when I firſt was ſwaddeled, or els had neuer bene knowen, that none might haue taken delight in it. So ſoone as my beautie was ſounded abroad, this Knight héere preſent, King of the <hi>Zardians,</hi> Lorde of the Iland of <hi>Zardia,</hi> called <hi>Raiartes,</hi> hearing of it, came to ſee me, &amp; ſo ſoone as he came, he was taken with my loue, and demaunding me for wife, was denied it of my father. Wherefore very angrie returning to his Iland of <hi>Zardia,</hi> with a great armie of knights, he came againſt my father, and at the firſt field killed him, and murthered all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in ſhort time became Lord of <hi>Cypres.</hi> My mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſéeing my Father dead, and hir lande waſted, dyed for griefe. I remained alone without companye, till ſuch time as <hi>Raiartes</hi> came to the Pallaice where I was. I knew to whoſe power I was become ſeruaunt, &amp; fearing that he woulde haue forced me, determined by ending my lyfe, to make my ſelfe free from his ſubiection, eſtéeming it farre better to dye with my Parentes, then alyue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle their deathes. And hauing no better leaſure nor meanes to achieue my purpoſe, I leaped vp to a window, the higheſt in all the Pallaice, thence to haue throwen my ſelfe downe, if <hi>Raiartes</hi> ſéeing me in his plight had not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13855:47"/>prayed me not to doo it, promiſing if I forbeare that, that to doo the thing that I cmmaunded him. I reſoluing vpon death, told him, that vnles he granted me one gift, I wold be mine owne executioner: he, to ſaue my life, promiſed it, whereby I lefte off from putting that in practiſe, which I had contriued in my thought. By this meanes, <hi>Raiartes</hi> had me in his power, and hauing the whole Iland at his commaundement, he carried me contrary to my will into his owne country, with theſe aged Knights my néere kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there he requeſted me of loue, and prayed me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him for huſband. What ſhould I doo, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate in his demanund, and I remayned in his daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſo that to put by the execution of his deſire, I had none other remedy but to aunſwere him, that ſo ſoone as he had perfourmed the promiſe which he made mee, I woulde ſatiſfie his whole intent. This hearing, he was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſo I tolde him that he ſhoulde carrie me for the ſpace of a twelue month into all places, whether I would, and if in the meane time. I found a knight to defende my right by fighting againſt him, he ſhould graunt the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, with condition, that if my knight vanquiſhed him, I ſhould be fré from his demaund, and my lande at quiet, otherwiſe, if he had the vpper hand, I from thence-foorthe, to be at his commaundement, and he doo what euer lyked him. This knight, moſt noble <hi>Souldan,</hi> counfailing with his ſtrength, and thinking all mens vertues infertor to his, tooke vpon him the Queſt, glad by ſuch meanes to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his power, and ſo he carried me from the Iland <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> more then halfe a yere paſt, in which time yet I haue not found a Knight to vndertake my quarrell, and yet I haue bene in the courts of mightie Kings and other great Lords. Now ſéeing the tearme ſet betweene vs, is more then halfe expired, for my laſt refuge hether am I come to thy court to proue, if heere my good fortune ſhould be ſuch, that I ſhould finde in it that which I haue ſo long ſued for in other Courts.</q>

The Gentleman of the Sunne thanked her goodly for the acceptation of his paines in her name. In this manner the matter was put off till the next day, but the Gentleman of the Sunne was not ſo glad, to haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered to bée made knight, as the Souldan and his friendes were ſorrowfull, to haue him fall into this daunger, which they imagined to be to too ſure, becauſe of the ſtrength of <hi>Raiartes,</hi> and the youth of the Gentleman of the Sunne. They thought it a deſperate caſe for him to wage this battaile, with the ſauegard of his honour. Then the young Gentleman <hi>Clauerindo</hi> béeing of more
<pb facs="tcp:13855:50"/>yeares then <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> was, repented that hée had not aunſwered for the Princeſſe, both becauſe hée thought it a blemiſh to his honour to haue excuſed himſelfe from ſuch a matter, and his age was more then <hi>Donzel del Febos</hi> was, and ſo might better acquite himſelfe agaynſt the force of <hi>Raiartes,</hi> and eſpecially fearing the perill of his friend, he would néedes haue taken the battaile out of his handes, but perceiuing the vnwillingneſſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Sunne hée would ſpeake no more of it. At Sunne ſet <hi>Florion</hi> came from hunting, and hearing of the battaile which was appointed, he was verie ſad for <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel del Febos</hi> ſake, becauſe of <hi>Raiartes</hi> force, and <hi>Donzels</hi> weakneſſe, and ſo he tooke vpon him to perſwade <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> to giue ouer the battaile, and put it vpon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his right, if it ſo pleaſed him. But <hi>Florion</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo</hi> were both beguiled in <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> albeit ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them were ſuch knights, as of the one hath ben re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, and of the other ſhal be ſhewed héereafter. <hi>Raiartes</hi> was ſtrong, and his lyke ſcarcely among the Pagans, and it might be, it would ill haue proued with them two, as a man would haue ſworne it, onely by the tenour of <hi>Raiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> countenance, no man beholding him but with the ſame good will which they beare vnto the Diuell. And if <hi>Florion</hi> and <hi>Clauerindo</hi> deſired this battaile, it is to be thought it ſprang of theyr loue towardes <hi>Donzel del Febo,</hi> rather then of anie comfort their courage gaue them to winne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the battaile. But the daye was ſpent, and thinges neceſſarie for the battaile were in prouiding. At night <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> the wiſe comming from the redde Iland, tooke landing at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and méeting with the Gentleman of the Sunne, hée tolde him that many dayes had paſſed ſince he knewe of the conflict betwéene <hi>Raiartes</hi> and him, and therefore had brought certeine armour for him, and ſo hée commaunded his Squiers to vntie theyr two packets, out of the one packet <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> tooke a white armour wrought with beames of golde deſcending from his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13855:50"/>wherein was grauen a face ſo fayre and ſhéene, that it ſhedded out beames as the Sunne, and ſcarcely for the brightneſſe might a man behold it, and out of the ſame he tooke out a ſwoorde all garniſhed with golde, and emboſſed with precious ſtones, the pomell, ſcabbard, and chape being ſo rich and curious, that none there was which praiſed not the workmanſhippe. Out of the other packet hée drewe out another white armour pounced with <hi>Floure de Luces</hi> of golde, and another ſwoorde, both which he gaue to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerindo,</hi> beſtowing the other vppon <hi>Donzel del Febo.</hi>

               <p>With theſe good armours the two Gentleman were well apayde, eſpecially the Gentleman of the Sunne, which more eſtéemed of this gift, then of all the ſegniories of the earth.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13855:51"/>with rich harneſſe, in which were enchaſed ſundrie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, all both horſe and harneſſe of the Souldans gift, himſelfe béeing clad with his bright armour his vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berere pulled downe, and a mightie ſpeare in his hande, ſo bigge as they all meruayled of his good making. When <hi>Cheualiero del Febo</hi> ſtayed, <hi>Raiartes</hi> drewe néere, and with a lowde voyce ſayd vnto him. <q>Thou preſumptuous knight, what woldſt thou now giue me not to be here alone with me? Doeſt thou not thinke it no wiſdome to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy bodie, where there is no hope of ſafetie? Aſſuredly <hi>Raiartes,</hi> aunſ wered the knight of the Sunne, hetherto I haue not ſéene the thing wherefore I ſhould repent me of my enterpriſe, and hetherto I haue had more experience of thy vaine and fooliſh wordes, then of thy great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant proweſſe.</q> 
                  <hi>Raiartes,</hi> was fell angrie at this (the foame ſtaring through his viſour) woulde haue runne vppon the knight, but being awarded by the Iudges to the liſts, while the Trumpets ſounded, he groned out thus much to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the curſing of his Fortune. O howe doth For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enuie my felicitie in prolonging the time thus, that I cannot ſo ſoone as I wold diſpatch this wretched knight, ſayeng this and ſomewhat elſe, the Trumpets ſtayed, and with greate rage hée ranne towardes the Knight of the Sunne, but the Knight bearing his ſhéelde before him, with his Speare in his hande, met <hi>Raiartes</hi> with all his force, with the violence of this courſe, the ground ſhooke vnder theyr horſes, and this firſt iourney braſt their great Speares into ſmall ſhéeuers. <hi>Raiartes</hi> with the ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countrie of the knight of the Sunne, doubled and fell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the arſon of the ſaddle, his horſe carryeng him out of the preaſe to bluſh without companie, for neuer in his life time he had receiued the lyke blowe. But when hée reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his ſeate, and ſawe the Knight of the Sunne not ſtirred in his ſaddle, and now with his ſwoord in his hand comming toward him, he drew out his ſwoord which was broad and he auie, in great choler to receiue him, thinking
<pb facs="tcp:13855:52"/>for a ſuretie with the edge of his ſwoorde, to ſupplie that which had failed in the point of his Speare. Both of them madde angrie, <hi>Raiartes</hi> to amend that which hée had mard in breaking his Speare, and the Knight of the Sunne to reuenge the proude woordes which <hi>Raiartes</hi> had ſpoken, their firſt blowes were ſuch, that their pauices were hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſunder, and fell to the ground, the other part they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter threw from them, and griping theyr ſwoords in both theyr handes, they hit each other ſuch blowes vppon the Helmet, that flakes of fire iſſued after them. By this time neither of theſe Knightes were well pleaſed with the other, and they let driue ſo each at other, that in ſhort ſpace they made plaine their ſingular manhoods, and they which ſaw it iudged it to be the braueſt battaile which they had euer ſéene betwéene two knights. The valiant knights with malicious eies, ſorrwing eath at others welfare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their armour was ſo good that no ſwoord coulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were much more wood, layeng about them without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and caring not where they hit, ſo they might ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud ſpin as faſt as the ſparkles increaſed.</p>
               <p>It was not halfe an houre ſince the battell began, and <hi>Raiartes</hi> well féeling the courage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight of the Sun, in that he had gotten none aduauntge ouer him in all the time. Now with what courage fought he thinke you, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides himſelf for the deſire of the Ladie, at that time he doubted whether this were the Gentleman of the Sun, whom before he had continued, and if it wer not he, yet hée meruailed in himſelfe who this valiunt knight might be, in the meane while the Souldan and <hi>Florion</hi> with all the beholders of the battaile were aſtoniſhed at the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe and valour which the knight of the Sunne ſhewed againſt <hi>Raiartes.</hi> They thought truly that he would proue the beſt knight of the world, ſith in ſo tender yeares hée was of great vertue. The Princeſſe <hi>Radamira</hi> which loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on this battaile before, halfe againſt hir will for feare, now viewing how wel the knight had behaued himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13855:52"/>her enimie, with greater ioy and hope ſhe gaſed on him, and often praied her Gods to grant him the victorie. But as I tolde you, <hi>Raiartes</hi> ſeeing his aduerſarie ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntly beare himſelfe againſt him, and not béeing able to gouerne his ill will, he lift himſelfe vp in his ſtirops and lent the Knight of the Sunne a blowe with all his force, that although hée coulde not cut his fine helmet, yet hée made him bowe his head to his horſe necke, béeing blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the continuall ſparkes of fire which came out of his head péece. The worthie knight of the Sunne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againe to himſelfe and ſitting ſurer in his ſaddle, retourned the lyke blowe to <hi>Raiartes,</hi> ſo that <hi>Raiartes</hi> loſt his memorie, and receiued another blowe on his bulke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the ſaddle bowe, which made the bloud guſh out of his mouth and noſethrills, and the knight of the Sunne followed him to haue vnhorſed him. But <hi>Raiartes</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and ere the Knight of the Sunne coulde hit him, hée gaue him on the lefte ſhoulder a mightie blowe, that with the weight thereof he had falne to the ground, but for the imbracing of his horſe necke. Againe <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> repaied him with a <hi>plus vltra,</hi> the ſurpluſage more then an ordinarie intereſt, and they wounded each other, mangling themſelues pittifully, and the claſhing of their armour was ſo great, that it rang like bells in all the citie.</p>
               <p>This was the ſecond houre of the fight, and the match was equall, not béeing knowne who had the better hand. <hi>Raiartes</hi> not greatlye pawſing, but in his anger reuiling his Gods, ſayde vnto himſelfe. <q>O immortall Gods, howe little is <hi>Raiartes</hi> beholding vnto you if a man is able to reſiſt his might? Why? If the reporte of my valyaunt déedes and noble proweſſe made knowne to the heauens cauſeth you to maligne my ſtate, come you downe and fight with mée, for I had rather be vanquiſhed by your Deities, then to bée yeelded to mans ſtrength. But what canne I thinke, eyther then that this Knight is one of you, for the loue of <hi>Radamira,</hi> to take her ryght
<pb facs="tcp:13855:53"/>in hande, or at the leaſt ſome fiende of Hell in lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Knight, minded to quell mée. But ſéeing this is the iſſue, that if I looſe this daie, I muſt looſe <hi>Radamira</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, let him winne her and weare her: for bée hée what he may be, he ſhall get no honour at my handes,</q> and ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng, he ſtroke his aduerſarie ſo ſore on the breaſt, that he bruſed his carcaſſe, and put him in great daunger. <hi>Cheua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liero del Febo</hi> not a little abaſhed at the great force of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iartes,</hi> this being the firſt battaile that euer he had fought, thought in himſelfe that if all the knightes in the worlde were lyke him, he ſhoulde get but ſmall praiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to embolden his courage, he rated himſelfe on this wiſe. <q>Am I he of whom the wife <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> hath foretold ſo much? Am I hée without whome the <hi>Babylonians</hi> dare not ſet foot into <hi>Perſia?</hi> Am I he for whom they haue thus long time waited? Certainly if this be all which I ſhal be able to doe, ſhall not all happen contrarie to that which the wiſe man hath ſayd? Shall not the <hi>Babylonians</hi> bée moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of their hope? Hath not one onely knight much enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged me? what ſhall the whole multitude of the <hi>Perſians</hi> do, &amp; the puiſſance of the Gyants which ſhall come to aſſiſt them? Had it not bene better for my credit not to haue bene borne, with ſo greate fame as the Aſtrologers haue forſhewed, then in ſo ſhort a time ſo much to bée troubled. O Souldan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and you others which are Iudges in the fielde, are you not aſhamed of mée, that in my firſt battayle, and the firſt fruites of my knighthoode, I am at the point to become recreaunt. But recreaunt I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be, and ſo as it were blowing the coales of his anger, when he was on a light fire, hée ſet <hi>Raiartes</hi> in ſuch a heat, with his thicke and mightie ſtrokes, that the vnlacing of his helme, and the vnmailing of his armour could ſcarce giue him breath inough.</q> 
                  <hi>Raiartes</hi> then thought that his enimyes ſtrength increaſed, yet not altogether fown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he aunſwered him as well as he coulde, that the battayle ſéemed to be more fierce at that time then at the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13855:53"/>beginning. The houre clock hath ſmitten thrice, ſince they entered the lyſtes, all much meruailyng how they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure ſo long. The <hi>Souldan</hi> ſayd to <hi>Florion</hi> and to the wiſe man which ſate by, <q>certainly, if I had not ſéene it with my eyes, I ſhould hardly haue beléeued, that a knight of ſo young yeares, as this knight of the Sunne is, might haue had the force ſo to endaunger a worthy knight, for you know how the houres are paſſed, ſince they began the combate, and how yet he abideth manye blowes, and ſtill ſeemes as freſh as he was when he firſt came foorth. The wiſe man aunſwered, yea, my Lord, but if you knew with whom he doth fight, you might with more reaſon mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile at it. For <hi>Raiartes</hi> is one of the ſtrongeſt and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt knights that is among the Pagans, and his pride is ſo great, that he alone would not refuſe to ioyne with an C. knights, and would well thinke to haue the maſterie of them all, before he would be taken.</q> Thus the bench was not idle, and the Princeſſe <hi>Radamira</hi> very buſely attended vpon hir knight, and watched euery turne, more then halfe ioyfully, ſpeaking thus vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Baliſea</hi> ſtanding by. <q>I beléeue for a certaintie Princes <hi>Baliſea,</hi> that our high Gods now at length cloyed with my miſhaps, haue proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this knight for me, for in reſpect of his beautie &amp; great bountie, he ſéemeth rather heauenly then terreſtriall. Yea, ſo I thinke, then aunſwered the Princeſſe <hi>Baliſea,</hi> and that not onely for your ſuccour, but to ayde me and my cauſe, the Gods haue ſent him hether, for by him I looke to bée quéene of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Do you ſo madame ſayd <hi>Radamira,</hi> now I pray our Gods that he well eſcape this battaile, to fulfill your heartes deſire, and truely if he become victour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſhall be auenged on him for my fathers death, but I will make account that I am now riſen from death to life, for ſooner had I purpoſed to kill my ſelfe, then to lie in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iartes</hi> armes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But all this while the good knightes plied the combat, fighting couragiouſly till they were fore wearied, euerie
<pb facs="tcp:13855:54"/>one miſconſtruing the euent. For <hi>Raiartes</hi> ſeeing that the longer the battaile laſted, the farther he was from the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, with all the force he might, he ſtroke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight of the Sunne ſuch a blow on the helmet, that his ſences wer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft him, &amp; had he not taken hold of the ſaddle bow, he had kiſſed the ground. So the fray was renued, but the knight of the Sunne gaue <hi>Raiartes</hi> another blow as ſtrong, which bewitched his vnderſtanding, for his horſe carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the field, toſſing him on the pomell of his ſaddle, as if he had bene dead. The knight of the Sunne thinking it no glory to ſmite a man halfe dead, purſued him not, but <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iartes</hi> reuiuing, his face all bloudy, with both his hands hit the knight of the Sunne vppon the head péece, that if the helme had not bene the ſurer, it had riuen him to the belly, but the ſtroke amaſed him, and the goare bloud ran out of his month and noſtrells, and his horſe féeling part of the great blow, carried his maſter from thence, the good knight lieng vpon the crouper of his horſe, in an extaſie, as if hée had bene quite dead. <hi>Raiartes</hi> haſted to haue giuen him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother blow, thoſe which ſaw it, were verie ſad, but none were euer ſo wofully begon, as was the Princeſſe <hi>Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> who with great griefe tourning hir ſelfe from that ſight, and fell on wéeping bitterly. But <hi>Raiartes</hi> had not followed him foure paces with his horſe, when the good knight ſtart vp, and féeling his face wet with bloud, in great fury ſpurred his horſe, and met <hi>Raiartes</hi> with ſuch a blow, that the fine helmet could not denie him paſſage, but that he cloue <hi>Raiartes</hi> head in ſunder. Heere the ſhoote of the people, and the Princeſſe <hi>Baliſeas</hi> calling hir, awaked the Princeſſe <hi>Radamira,</hi> as it had bene out of a ſound fléep, and little looking for ſo good newes: and the good Knight, (<hi>Raiartes</hi> béeing dead) put vp his ſword into the ſheath, &amp; demaunded of the Iudges if there were ought els to doo to make the Princeſſe frée. The Princeſſe heard this gladly, and the Iudges aunſwered him no, for that had ſufficed, which he had done. Then with the noyſe of inſtruments,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13855:54"/>and much honour, the Iudges led the knight of the Sunne from that place to the Pallaice, where, with great ioy and pleaſure of the Souldan and <hi>Florion,</hi> he was well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they ſhewing as much good will to him, as if they had neuer inough in making of him. The Gentleman <hi>Claue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryndo</hi> and <hi>Brandizel,</hi> glad of their friends conqueſt, holp to vnarme him. Then the Princeſſe <hi>Baliſea</hi> came, &amp; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Radamira,</hi> dooing hir dutie to the knight of the Sun, and as not able els to requite the courteſie he had ſhowen hir, ſhe offered to him both hir lands and hir perſon, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſerue him. Thus they tooke their reſt many dayes, &amp; the good knight was much honoured of them all. And ther was a great feaſt made, and diuers Iuſtes and Turnayes there proclaimed, for the dubbing of <hi>Clauerindo</hi> and other Gentlemen Knights. At this feaſt, the Prince <hi>Claueryndo</hi> behaued him beſt, ſo that all men iudged him to be a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant knight.

What art thou knight ſo bolde and venterous, that haſt in ſuch wiſe diſturbed our Campe, with the noyſe of thy horne. The Knight of the Sunne replyed. I am a Knight of the Souldans which come to the king <hi>Africano</hi> to make him anſwere to the letter by him ſent vnto the Souldan. Now returne you backe and tell him, I am héere to doe my meſſage, and if he will heare it, bidde him come armed and well horſed, for otherwiſe I will not make him aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. The gyant very ſcornfully tooke vp a great laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and giuing the Knight a lyttle ſowce on the helmet with his gauntlet, he ſayd vnto him. <q>Now I tell thée, that thou art the maddeſt Knight in the worlde, to challenge him to battayle, at the onely hearing of whoſe name, the greateſt part of all <hi>Aſia</hi> doth tremble, and if thou wert not a ſimple, foole thou wouldeſt not in ſuch ſort diſcouer thine impotencie. If thou haſt any meſſage to the King <hi>Africano</hi> from the Souldan, come with mée and thou ſhalt be brought to his preſence, for hée is not ſuch a one as to come into the field againſt one ſely Knight. The king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frinano</hi> himſelfe muſt heare my meſſage, ſayde the Knight of the Sunne, and hée muſt heare it armed, for otherwiſe I will not open it.</q> The ſtrong <hi>Herbyon</hi> was angrie at the knightes words, and thinking him to bée but as other knights were, or amongeſt the meaneſt, he offered to haue ſet the knight beſide the ſaddle, and ſo to haue drawne him perforce to the king, ſhewing héerein no leſſe pride and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine then the gréedie Fawlcon doth in the purſute of the ſimple Pigeon, to carrie it to the ayre among the young ones. But his lot was farre otherwiſe, for the knight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing his intent, turned the point of his ſpeare, &amp; ſtrake him ſo ſtrongly on the cheſt, that though his armour were good, it entered a lyttle, and left him windleſſe for a time. <hi>Herbyon</hi> thought himſelfe nowe not well at eaſe, and therefore returning to himſelfe, hee neuer ſtudyed at
<pb facs="tcp:13855:58"/>the curteſie of the knight in ſparing him in this traunce, but taking one parte of the fielde, and broching his horſe with the ſpurs, his Speare béeing in the reſt, with deadly rage he ranne againſt the knight of the Sunne, who was nothing ſlow in the receipt. Their ſhockes were ſuch in their méeting, that the heauie ſpeare of the ſtrong <hi>Herby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> brake into ſhiuers in the fine helmet of the knight of the Sun, not diſeaſing him. But the knight of the Sunne hit the Gyant with ſuch dexteritie that he ouerthrew him, and the great waight of his body made the Gyant weare his necke on the to ſide lyke a ſidler, which was no lyttle paine vnto him. Yet he gate vppon his féete, riſing with much a doe. Then the knight of the Sunne finding him vpriſen, bad him defend himſelfe. <q>The Gyaunt aunſwered that hée coulde not, therefore doe, with mée what you will. The Knight of the Sunne ſayde no, but retourne to the king <hi>Africano</hi> thy Lorde, and tell him that a Knight of the Souldans doth awaite him héere, to make aunſwere vnto his letter, and if ſo bée hée bée minded to heare it, will him in his armour to come foorth, for in no other order will I vtter it.</q> The Gyant aunſwered he would doe it, and not béeing able to ſit on horſbacke, hée was compelled to goe on foote through the campe, driuing in his thought the remembraunce of the Knightes proweſſe, ſo that hée was perſwaded that not twentie knights <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> could haue done him ſo much harme as this one knight had done. The Souldan with the Princes <hi>Florion</hi> and <hi>Claue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindo</hi> were no leſſe amazed in their contemplation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the euent of the firſt welcome, and they gaue greate thanks to their Gods for ſending them ſo good a Knight. <hi>Herbyon</hi> came before the king <hi>Africano</hi> his Lorde, and without failing in anie part, declared to him that which had chaunced with the knight, and the meſſage which was ſent by him. Moreouer, telling the king that hée thought that knight to bée the ſtrongeſt knight in the worlde, for that with theſe two blowes which he had giuen him, hée
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13855:58"/>had throwen him to the ground, and might haue killed him.</p>
               <p>The king <hi>Africano</hi> not a little ſorrie to ſée the ſtrong <hi>Herbyon</hi> ſo ill intreated &amp; abaſhed at the force of one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Knight, woulde therevpon haue put on his armour to haue bene auenged on the knight and to heare his meſſage. But the other Gyaunt then in preſence called <hi>Dardario,</hi> and much about <hi>Herbyons</hi> pitch, béeing of no leſſe value then the firſt, in his choler menacing the knight, ſwore a great oath that he would bring the knight bound hand and foote vnto the king, wherefore taking a great horſe he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the campe, and approching néere the Knight of the Sunne, he would not ſalute the Knight, but as his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was throughly kindled, with a greate ſpeare as big al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as a Pine trée, hée prepared himſelfe for the carrier. And the worthie Gréeke knowing the Gyants errand, did the lyke, and ſpurring his horſe he came vnto the cloſe. The great ſpeare of the Gyant was thought to haue pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the harneſſe of the knight, by reaſon of the few ſhiuers that it made, but it did not ſo, and contrariwiſe the knights ſpeare couched with greate dexteritie, entered through the body of the great <hi>Dardario,</hi> a great part of the ſtaffe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>By this meanes the monſtrous Gyant fell dead from his horſe with ſuch a grone, as the tall Cedars of <hi>Libanus</hi> make, béeing rent vp by the roote. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced excéedingly at this: but <hi>Africano</hi> was all enflamed with choler to fée his Gyaunt ſlaine with one onely blow, and knowing that to himſelfe alone this baſe was bid, in great rage roſe from the feate where he ſate, without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a word, &amp; entering into his tent, armed himſelfe with ſure armour, and choſe him a very ſtrong Speare, not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieng for ſquire or page to helpe him.</p>
               <p>In this anger hée was ſo terrible that none of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple durſt come néere him, and ſo with a moſt fierce &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell countenance he armed himſelfe. So ſoone as the Pagan
<pb facs="tcp:13855:59"/>had buckled on his armour, immediatly ther was brought him a horſe, ſuch a one as could haue carried tenne armed knights, as I thinke, of the ſame bredth whereof the horſe of <hi>Troy</hi> was. The trappings of the horſe as well golde, as the ſtirops and all his armour ſet with precious ſtones, that hée might well ſéeme a great Lord which was may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſuch armorie, but this was the ſtraungeſt ſight, that <hi>Africano</hi> ſat vpon ſo mightie a horſe, made him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to bow &amp; double vnder him. But to go forwarde, <hi>Africano</hi> taking the greateſt Speare which might be had, rode with a ſoft pace towardes the knight of the Sunne. The Knight of the Sunne ſawe him come from amongſt his people, and thought preſently that he was the king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricano,</hi> as well for his rich armour, and his horſe ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly barbed, as the taleneſſe of his perſonage which hée verie well noted, not to bée farre diſſonant from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report: ſo he beſéeched his Gods from his heart to be fauourable vnto him againſt ſo ſtrong a Gyant. <hi>Africano</hi> well viewed the knight of the Sunne, his ſtature and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and vpon theſe premiſes inferred thus much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> well might he be a man of much force, which ſo well ſhewed it in his exteriour countenance, and much more in his déeds and valour. But comming néerer vnto the knight as his cuſtome was little to regarde the whole worlde, ſo with a proud &amp; diſdainfull voice he ſpake vnto the knight. <q>Thou miſerable and wretched knight, thou ſaiſt thou art a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger and bringeſt a meſſage vnto me, thou haſt ſlaine the Gyant <hi>Dardario</hi> &amp; almoſt the ſtrong <hi>Herbion,</hi> which two had bene ſufficient to haue beat downe the walls of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> I ſweare vnto thée by my Gods, that if all the world were giuen me for thy ranſome, thou ſhouldeſt not eſcape the death. The knight of the Sunne embaſing his voice, mildly anſwered. If I haue had to doe with thy Gyaunts <hi>Africano,</hi> they were occaſioners of it themſelues, for I came not hether to other purpoſe, but to make thée anſwere in the behalfe of the Souldan, and if I came onely to ſéeke
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13855:59"/>thée thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oughteſt to haue bene firſt which ſhould haue preſented himſelfe to me, and to haue heard what I wold haue ſayde, and to haue heard me as a meſſenger, and not to attempt my death as a knowen enimie. Now that thou art come <hi>Africano,</hi> I tell thée why I am come, heare it if thou wilt. The Gods which haue preſerued mée from thy Gyauntes, haue reſerued me to fight with thée. But liſten on, &amp;c.</q> Héere the rage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pagan ſtopped the courſe of his talke, and the mightie <hi>Africano</hi> ſmiting his hande on his thigh, for anger lift vp his other hand alſo to haue buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the knight, but a better minde ouertooke him, that bée thought it reaſon to heare the Souldans aunſwrre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould condempne the meſſenger, and ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtayeng, he bad him tell on quickly, for I will well puniſh thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence what ſo euer aunſwere the Souldan ſendeth me.</p>
               <p>The knight of the Sunne wiſhing the battayle with all his heart, ſayd. <q>Then know thou <hi>Africano</hi> that thy letter béeing receiued and read in the preſence of my Lorde the Souldan; after conſultation had, my Lord ſendeth thée this anſwere by me. Albeit before this time thou art notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defamed for a tyrant, in that thou haſt falſely and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently enchroched vp many kingdomes, yet hée neuer thought thou wouldſt haue enterpriſed the vſurpation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt ſacred <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, an Empire conſecrated to the Gods, and claimed by them as their right, and in their right, gouerned by my Lordes aunceſtours as Liefete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts to the Gods, and their Fée-farmers, and therefore though peraduenture the open wrongs done vnto men, the Gods doe often pardon and winke at, yet ſeldome leaue they vnreuenged the iniuryes offered to themſelues, and as it is to be thought, ſo manifeſt a contempt of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power, ſhall not eſcape them. Beſides for the Citie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he letteth thée to vnderſtand, that thy ſelfe art not ignorant that it is his, and that he hath right to it as heire to the king <hi>Orixerges</hi> his father on that parte of his liueloode, and that thou haſt no title nor coulourable ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:13855:60"/>to demaund it. Wherefore if it be ſo that thou wilt take it againſt all reaſon from him, he telleth thée that hée can no leſſe doe then defend it from thée and the whole world, for hauing right and iuſtice on his ſide, hée lyttle feareth the inuaſion of man, deliuering his meſſage in this forme of wordes, the knight of the Sunne ſayde. This is the Souldans anſwere, and pauſing a while, he began againe thus. And I <hi>Africano</hi> craued of my Lord to be the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, for I would thou ſhouldeſt know how dangerouſly thou offendeſt the diuine Gods in entering vpon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and diſinheriting the Prince <hi>Florion,</hi> the legittimate and onely Lord of that kingdome.

But the morning, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre ſpent, they lefte off for that time, and departed all from the Pallaice towards the Souldans armie, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their people in order, they paſſed out of the gates, with all things prepared for to kéepe the field.</q> The Knight of the Sunne accompanied with the Souldan, and the other two Princes, <hi>Florion</hi> and <hi>Claueryndo, Armineo,</hi> and the wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo,</hi> rode to the place appoynted, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the conditions concluded vpon.

               <p>Now are the two couragiouſeſt Knightes, in all the world lefte the one againſt the other, with ſo fierce and manly countenaunces, that it might haue diſmayed the ſpectators. When the ſound of the Trumpet had ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to the Battaile, the two ſtrong Knights girding their Horſes with their ſpurres, rode the one againſt the other, with ſuch vyolence, as if the Clowdell had rent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, by the out-braſting of the Thimder-ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They ſtrake each other ſuch heauie blowes, that warding them on their ſhields, although they were of pure ſtéele, yet they cleaued them in the middeſt, and their ſwords ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on their helmets driuing out great ſparkles of fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The great <hi>Africano</hi> gaue the Knight of the Sunne vpon his helmet ſuch buffets and with ſuch force, that euery man would haue iudged it had riuen the head-péece. There the cunning of the wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, for it was not poſſible for yron, ſtéele, or Adamant ſtone, but to haue yéelded to that ſtroke. But what thinke you that the Knight of the Sunne did, when hée thought that he had loſt his hearing by it, and ſaid to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that not without good cauſe <hi>Africano</hi> was greatly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among the Pagans. Nay, to the no leſſe meruaile of both hoaſts, the Knight of the Sunne let driue at <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano</hi> with ſuch force, as it was to the no ſmall admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all men, that he hewed him not in péeces. But you muſt learne, that when <hi>Africano</hi> paſſed by Sea from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> it was his chaunce to ſaile by <hi>Lemnos,</hi> where <hi>Vulcans</hi> Forge was. There he heard of <hi>Vulcans</hi> caue where his ſtore-houſe was, and entering into it, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued ſtraunge things, not héere to be recounted, and gained <hi>Vulcans</hi> armour, wrought with his owne handes, the beſt in all the land. This when <hi>Africano</hi> tryed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be very good, whereof he was well pleaſed, from that time forrth, he neuer fought with other hut with that. Now, albeit this head-peece was well framed from being cut, yet the knight of the Sunnes blowes were ſo heauy, that oftentimes <hi>Africano</hi> wiſt not where he was, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering would ſay vnto himſelfe. What is this? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the ſtrength of the whole world conſpireth with this Knight againſt me, and if it be not ſo, that he is of the off-ſprings of our Gods, yet am I ſure that hée is no man. But among all the great blowes which the Knight of the Sunne lent to <hi>Africano</hi> there was one at the fore-ende of the battaile, vppon the toppe of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:13855:63"/>helmet, the ſworde not entering, but ſliding downe vpon his ſhoulders, with ſuch force that it made him leane all his body vpon the horſe-necke, whereof if he had not taken holde, he had fallen to the ground. Then the Pagan ſure inough yet in his ſaddle, and his force redoubling as his anger increaſed, ſmote at the inchaunted helmet, that he made the knight confeſſe in his thought, that his helmette was his good borrow. The blowe ſounded throughout all the field, as if it had bene a bell, and the Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun with the waight of the blow, neither bolt vpright, nor full declining, but ſtaieng vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arſon, drouped as halfe dead. But the bloud guſhing out of his noſe, fetched him againe quickly, ere that <hi>Africano</hi> could come within him. Nowe, ſeeing it time to defenve himſelfe from his aduerſarie, hée ſtood vpright in his ſtirrops, &amp; with both his hands ſtrake at <hi>Africano,</hi> ſo that if the worke-man had not bene more to blame, the blow had made peace betwéene them, but for all the work-mans craft, the waight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blowe bruſed the helmet, which was the cauſe of <hi>Africanos</hi> ſpéedier death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Africano</hi> benummed of his ſences, the bloud ſtraining tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the ioynts of the helmet, and he ſitting in his ſaddle as halfe dead. The horſe ſore daunnted with the blowe, ſtood ſtill till <hi>Africano</hi> reuiued, and in the gathering of his ſtrength, out-brayed thus much in his thought. O infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall furies, are you not all hired againſt me? Or is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that either <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or <hi>Saturne,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> or all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods, may haue the like force as this young man. But <hi>Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> heart failed him not, albeit his words out-raged, for he followed the Knight of the Sunne, who attended him ſpéedely.</p>
               <p>Then the Prince <hi>Florion</hi> ſayd to the Souldan his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, <q>We make great account of the trauailes of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> our fore-fathers, and of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> with whom our countri-men ioyned, at the expedition of <hi>Troy:</hi> but I cannot thinke, that euer two ſo ſtrong warriours haue bene, as <hi>Africano</hi> and <hi>Raiartes.</hi>

Now it was more then two houres ſince the battaile began, and then Fortune alwayed fickle and vnſtable which had of a long time gone euen with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican o,</hi> now played hir part in hir kinde, and as alreadye wearie of his companie, tourned hir tale, and ſtroke in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, deſirous to ſhewe the great ſwiftneſſe of hir e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-turning whéele, and minding the ſodaine ouer-throwe of thoſe which too much truſt in hir.

And ſo the iſſue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Knight of the Sunne. For the ninth day after that the knight of the Sunne, <hi>Claueryndo,</hi> and thoſe which were with them had ſayled in the <hi>Perſicke</hi> ſea, the night attached them, ouercaſt with darke cloudes without anie ſtarres appearing, whereby the marriners conſtrued the roughneſſe of the weather on the morrowe, and therefore guided towardes land to caſt anchour in ſome good harbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe till the ſtormes ceaſed.

And there was a great fray betwixt them, the knight of the Sun nor <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryndo</hi> witting of it, till the great knight had ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en &amp; put to death fiue or ſixe of thoſe knights which came néereſt to hand.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne ſéeing his knightes ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, eſpecially by this greate Knight, leauing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bent his force againſt him, and ſtrake him a blowe ouerthwart the head péece, making him to abate his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The great Knight aunſwered the loane, and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle was verys hotte betwéene them, for though the night was darke, yet they knewe where to hit, as well by the flames which ſprang out of theyr helmets, as the claſhing of their armour: <hi>Claueryndo</hi> put himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the thickeſt, and at his firſt God-morrow ſlew ten knightes, and then not finding with whome to fight, hée leapt into his enimies Shippe with his vnckle <hi>Armineo,</hi> where hée felled more then. <hi>30.</hi> Knightes, and the ſkirmiſh began a freſh, either part willing to helpe theirs, and the foure ſhips grapled together, ſo that the fight woulde haue ben dangerous if it had laſted longer, but halfe an hour &amp; a lyttle more ouerpaſſed, the tempeſt which before threatned to appeare now outraged, and the porte not verie ſure, the foure Shippes were diuided by the ſtorme, euerye one withdrawing himſelfe to ſéeke ſuccour. Now in the Ship wherein the knight of the Sunne and the greate Knight fought, there were no more Knightes but they two,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:69"/>for all followed <hi>Clauerindo</hi> into the other ſhippes. The two knights left alone were ſo earneſt that they tooke little keepe either of the tempeſt or of their danger. The ſucceſſe of the battaile was doubtfull, ſometimes enclining to the one part, ſometimes to the other, neither parte quailing, but gathering theyr ſtrengthes to them by the emulation of each other. For the knight of the Sunne verily beléeued that except his enimie had bene ſome ſuch as <hi>Africano</hi> was, hée could neuer haue bid thoſe mortall ſtrokes: and the other Knight thought as well that no mans force could be matchable with the knightes, and either of them both had better cauſe to thank <hi>Lyrgandeos</hi> kindneſſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this ſtrange knight at this time, for had not his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour kept out the edge of the other knights armant ſword he could not haue prolonged the battell till day light, yet at that time he was ſo ouermatched, that if a ſodeine aduenture had not broke vp their fight, he had ended his life in that place.</p>
               <p>But when it was broad daye, by this the battaile ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, that the ſtraunge Knight knewe the deuiſe of the Sunne, vppon the Knight of the Sunnes helmet, which when hée eſpyed, letting his Swoord fall, and lifting vp his beuere, he caſt himſelfe at the Knightes féete with this ſpeach. <q>Oh my Lord the Knight of the Sunne, pardon I pray, your friend, who by meere ignoraunce hath made vpon your perſon, and who acknowledgeth in you ſuch ſouereigne vertue as may not be in other, but in thoſe to whom our Gods haue imparted of theyr goodneſſe.

Now the Knight of the Sunne ſo ſoone as the others viſour was pulled vp, knew well that he was the Prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> whome his father not willing to make Knight before his yeares were more, had lefte with the Souldan in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </q> For he was ſcarcely eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13855:69"/>yeares of age, yet being in armour, he was as bigge as you haue heard off, and taking courage vppon his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in his Fathers abſence, he laye at the Souldan his Grandfather to be dubbed Knight, thinking it long till hée were with his father, and his great friends the Knight of the Sunne and the Prince <hi>Claueryndo.</hi> So after that hee had obtained his ſute of his Grand-father, he demaunded licenſe of departure of the Souldan and the Princeſſe <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſea</hi> his mother to paſſe into <hi>Perſia,</hi> which was graunted him, and two ſhippes charged with two hundred Knights to conuaye him thether, where after the fourth dayes ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that chaunced to him, which the Hiſtorye hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</p>
               <p>But to retourne, as ſoone as the Knight of the Sunne knew his déere friend the Prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> verye glad to haue found him ſo valyaunt and hardie, he imbraced him heartely, and ſo they communed of their owne affaires, and the deſire that each had to ſée others. But as they began their ſeuerall ſtories, by enter-chaunge of ſpeach, firſt one, &amp; then another, the Marriners cried, that the ſhip rent in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So ſome leapte into the water, and other threwe out plankes to ſaue themſelues by, and the Knight of the Sun finding the Cock-boate néere vnto him, let it downe into the water by a cable, and calling the Prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> hée lept into it firſt him-ſelfe. Thus much is ordinarie in the courſe of worldlie things, but that which is to come, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the credite of a ſtorie, as it were an extraordinarie miracle. For when the Knight of the Sunne lept into the boate, the cable rent in péeces, and with the force of the iumpe, and the rage of the windes together, the boate lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into the deapth, that the Prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> coulde not followe him, but got into a little boate, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the ſhippe had before taken. But by and by after theſe Princes had thus eſcaped, the ſhippe wherein they had bene, tore in péeces with the ſtorme. Some bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drowned, and other ſome in no little daunger, as

               <p>The Knight of the Sunne ſayling alone in the veſſell, and in ſuch feare of deſtruction, was not ſo ſtout harted, as to contemne the ſenceleſſe element, but confeſſing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becilitie of mans power ſubiected vnder theſe weak things as fire and water, beſides caſualties infinite more, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himſelfe vnto his Gods by earneſt prayer, not yet onely for himſelfe, but alſo for his friend <hi>Brandizel,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to diuine of his deliueraunce. Sitting thus in the boate all penſiue, till the windes were ſomewhat alayed, and the Sea waxed more calme, afterwards he looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and ſawe that he was out of daunger, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two things which made him more to meruayle.

<pb facs="tcp:13855:71"/>the wordes, which the wiſe <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> had ſpoken to the Knight of the Sunne at his departure.

For he was ſo gracious, as that he was beloued not onely of his mother, but of the other Gentlewomen alſo, which might not one minute ſpare his companie, as if he had bene childe to euerie one. This <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> when he attained to the age of twelue yeares, remooued out of the Moneſtarie to a houſe hard by, where his nourſe <hi>Leonardo</hi> kept, whom he thought to bée his father.

               <p>THe ſupper being readie, <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> with <hi>Balides,</hi> his wife and children ſate at the table, but there was little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at the boord, ſaue that the beautifull <hi>Lyuerba</hi> felt ſo great griefe in the remembrance of <hi>Argions</hi> meſſage, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in lieu of meate, ſhee fed on teares, and her parents helped to beare a part with their ſighes, which made it a very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike ſupper vnto <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> And in the necke of this, ere the cloth was taken vp they heard great rapping at the gate, &amp; looking who they were, they ſawe more then <hi>.20.</hi> knightes &amp; other ſeruing men, with torches in their hands at the gates. Thoſe of the houſe demaunded what they wold, one of them anſwered. Tell <hi>Balides</hi> that <hi>Argion</hi> our Lord hath commanded vs to bring <hi>Lyuerba</hi> by and by, for he tarrieth for her to haue her companie this night. O how vnwelcome was this arrant vnto the parents, &amp; how pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull vnto the Gentlewoman, which ſounded at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Argions</hi> name, &amp; all the houſeholde wept bitterly. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> for companie moued to great pittie, with the beſt courage y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might, to giue remedie vnto this outrage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed a preſent ſhift, &amp; bid ſome of the ſeruants to tell thoſe which were without, that they ſhoulde ſtay a while vntill the Gentlewoman were in a readineſſe, &amp; after that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhée ſhould be ſent vnto them. Then he made the coſtlyeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell which <hi>Lyuerba</hi> had to be brought vnto him, &amp; clothed himſelfe withall, making for his head a perwicke of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbas</hi> haire, &amp; binding it with a little chaine of gold, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being thus readily araied, he was ſo beautifull as no gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman thereabouts might parage him for grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. His hoſt &amp; hoſteſſe were amazed in beholding him ſo well beare out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> credit of a gentlewomas, in his diſguiſed habit, neither yet knowing what he meant thereby, nor yet minding to learne it of him vnleſſe he firſt declared it. But
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13855:76"/>ſo ſoone as he was throughly arayed in this wiſe, he ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rounded his hoſt in the eare, ſaieng. <q>My friend, your miſhap and the thraldome of this land hath had ſuch force ouer me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hauing hope in God which brought me hether, I will take vpon me to be <hi>Lyuerba,</hi> &amp; will goe with theſe knights to the caſtle of <hi>Argion.</hi> When I am alone in his chamber, I will behaue my ſelfe, God willing, that I will frée you from this mans tyrannie. Or though I be ſlaine in the execution of this enterprice, yet it were a ſmall da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in reſpect of ſo great a cure. But I would haue you <hi>Balides,</hi> your ſonnes, and your other acquaintaunce and friendes to arme your ſelues lykewiſe, and lye couertly a little from the caſtle, where if you ſée that I make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie tokens by the light at a windowe, make account that <hi>Argion</hi> is ſlaine, and be not afraide to come néere the gates which I will ſet open for you, and ſo with little ado we will make our ſelues Lords of his caſtle. When this is done, we will publiſh it abroad to the inhabitaunts of the valley, which being certeine of <hi>Argions,</hi> death will riſe to our ſuccour.</q> 
                  <hi>Balides</hi> looked wiſtly vpon <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and wondered at his courage, for he béeing ſo young, it was in his fancie for the boldeſt match which he had heard off, yet though it was impoſſible as he thought to come to their purpoſe, for that he ſawe how willingly <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had made this offer, he conſented to call his friends, eſtéeming it farre better to die in ſuch a quarrell, then to ſee &amp; ſuffer ſo great a miſchiefe. The Gentlewoman <hi>Lyuerba</hi> béeing made priuie therevnto by her father knéeled downe before <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and ſhedding aboundance of teares ſaid vnto him. <q>The God which created both heauen &amp; earth graunt you faire gentleman ſo good hap, that both this land may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit from this tyrannie, &amp; I deliuered from this villanie.</q> The knights which were without haſted to haue the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman with them, &amp; ſo <hi>Roſicleer</hi> putting ſwoord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his kirtle cloſely and ſurely, that it could neither bée perceiuied, nor fall from him, he tooke his leaue of <hi>Balides,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13855:77"/>his wife, and his daughter. <hi>Balides</hi> wiſhing him well and commending him to God, accompanied him to the gates where the knightes were attendaunt, and there poured out ſo many teares to the outward ſight as if it had bene his daughter. The people without hauing a glimps of <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> by the light of the Torches, tooke him to be fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Gentlewoman which they had euer ſéene, and verye gladde to bring ſo good tidings vnto their maſter, they ſet him vppon a palfraie prouided for the purpoſe, onely they were agréeued at the time which was ſo ſhort that they could not ſufficiently gaze on her. Their whole talke by the waie ranne vpon this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were for <hi>Argion</hi> more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to detaine her for wife, then euerie wéeke to ſeeke a newe, and laughing at theyr owne deuiſes they came to <hi>Argions</hi> Caſtle, béeing verye greate, and of building the moſt ſumptuous in the valley, as it had bene a kings pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice. In this they entered, and helping the fained <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerba</hi> from her horſe, they lead her vp a paire of ſtaires into a chamber where <hi>Argion</hi> awaited her comming. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> kéeping a demure and ſober countenaunce, droue <hi>Argion</hi> into a great amaze at his beautie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gréedely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him hée aroſe from the place where hée was ſet, and embraced him in theſe tearmes. You are welcome he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my <hi>Lyuerba,</hi> for you make me ryght gladde to haue your companie, and for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your beautye is more then the reſt, I will doe you more honoure then to others. The fained <hi>Lyuerba</hi> countenaunced out his counterfait with graue behauiour, onely fixing his eyes vpon the grounde, without aunſwering a worde, ſaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée thought vppon his purpoſe, which he knewe woulde bée ſomewhat daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, in that <hi>Argion</hi> was ſtrong, fowle, and fierce of looke more then euer he had ſéene anie. <hi>Argion</hi> tooke him by the hande, and placed him next himſelfe, demaunding firſt how her parents did, and from thence he fell to more amorous delights, ſtill ſtaring on <hi>Roſicleers</hi> beautie, which throughly kindled his luſt, and hée deſired her to vncloath
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13855:77"/>hir ſelfe, and to come vnto him, into the rich bedde. This ſuppoſed <hi>Lyuerba</hi> framing a ſhamefaſt and baſhfull looke, with a lowde voyce, gently aunſwered him, <q>that vnleſſe he commaunded his ſeruaunts to auoyde the chamber and the doores to be faſtened, ſhe would not be ſéene naked in that companie.</q> 
                  <hi>Argion</hi> taking it to be an argument of great honeſtie, did of his cloathes firſt, and lept into his bed, commanding his people to goe out, and ſhut the dores after them. They lighting a great candle ſet on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke of ſiluer went out, and there remained onelye this <hi>Lyuerba</hi> with <hi>Argion,</hi> leaſurely vncloathing hir-ſelfe, to delay time, and that the ſeruants ſhould miſtruſt naught, by hearing a buſtling in the chamber, firſt ſhe put off hir vpper gowne, then to hir peticoate, and ſo ſhe ſtaid a while, <hi>Argion</hi> calling on hir to diſpatch quickly, as if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his delight had bene to come, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it now time to diſcouer him-ſelfe, and that the houre was alreadye come, wherein God almightie woulde the wicked <hi>Argion</hi> to be chaſtiſed, caſt off his long garment, and tourned him-ſelfe into his dublet and hoſe, and hauing his ſword drawen, he came to <hi>Argions</hi> bed ſide, ſaying: <q>Come out of thy place where thou art thou foule letcher, and come to reioyce thée of <hi>Lyuerbas</hi> loue, for very bitter ſhall this nights reſt be vnto thée.</q> 
                  <hi>Argion</hi> which behelde him, roſe vp lightly, and taking a ſworde which hung at his beddes head, went towards <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to haue catched him in his armes, but <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with his naked ſworde watched him ſo, that he ſmote the necke from the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the head beating againſt the wall, and the bodie fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng headleſſe to the ground. This done, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> quietly ſate downe in the ſame place, and thus remained till the greater part of the night was ſpent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balides</hi> now in this time had not forgotten his charge, and hauing talked with more then twentye of his friends as concerning their intent, he eaſely perſwaded them to this enterpriſe, ſo hauing them in his companie,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:78"/>with his ſonnes, he lodged néere to <hi>Argions</hi> Caſtle, onely looking for a ſigne, which <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſhould make them out at a windowe, which when <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> had for a time neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, they ſuſpected the vnlikelihoode of the fact, and hadde retourned-cloſely to their homes, if that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had not then taking the light in his hand, opened the dores of the hall, and ſhewed the torch out of a windowe. Then they knew what had happened, and went ioyfully toward the Caſtle. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> comming downe, opened the gates, ſo that they all entered, and lighting many Torches which they brought with them, they caſt themſelues into ſeuerall companies to ſearch euerye corner, and ranging without feare throughout the Caſtle, when they knew that <hi>Argion</hi> was ſlaine, &amp; killing ſo manie as they found, that in deede, though there were moe then an hundred Knightes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeruaunts within the Caſtle, yet all were ſlaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could puruay of armour, or thinke of remedie, in ſuch ſort that in the Caſtle there was not one left to take <hi>Argions</hi> part. At <hi>Argion</hi> may the ſtout Lords and vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tyrants, take example of their endes, and make it a benefit of his fall, for although God ſometime forbeare the wicked giuing them ſpace of amendement and repentance, yet when they can in no wiſe be reclaimed, his iuſtice muſt of neceſſitie correct them in the maner that both their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies repay in this life their treſpaſſes, with cruell death and perpetuall diſhonour, and their ſoules in the other worlde receiue double diſgrace and horrour of conſcience for their miſdeedes. How many great Lords and tyrants haue we read of, to haue bene in the worlde, and how fewe or none haue we heard of vnpuniſhed, which can be no other thing, but that the diuine prouidence hath ſo ordained it, ſome to be chaſtiſed for the miſgouernment of themſelues, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome to amend by the terrour of others deſtruction. Well, the tyrant <hi>Argion</hi> thus being ſlaine with all his people, <hi>Balides</hi> &amp; thoſe which came with him for his great proweſſe in killing <hi>Argion,</hi> ſued vnto <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13855:78"/>them for his ſubiects, as they all woulde wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obey him for their Lord. But he ſeuerally making ſemblance of great loue to euerie partie, made them to riſe, aduiſing them on this ſort. That for their deliuerance they ought to attribute it vnto God with heartie thankes for it, which by his goodneſſe had prouided, that the euill luſt of wicked <hi>Argion</hi> ſhould laſt no longer. But for that they called him their Lord, he ſayd he would be their friend, &amp; neuertheleſſe, ſith they requeſted him there-vnto, that hée would not refuſe their profer, not for himſelfe, but indéed to giue order to that which ſhould ſucceede, for the quiet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the ſegniorie. This done, <hi>Balides</hi> ſent for his wife and his daughter <hi>Liuerba,</hi> with his houſe-hold. They comming before <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> gaue him thankes for this great good turne in procuring their ſafetie, he receiued them with great pleaſure, and they made merrie all that night.</p>
               <p>The next daye they deuiſed for the publication of <hi>Argions</hi> death, which <hi>Balides</hi> to be made knowen to the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall in the Valley. They all, verie deſirous of ſuch newes came to the Caſtle, where knowing the manner of <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ende, much praiſing the ſtrength and boldneſſe of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer,</hi> with all ſéeing him ſo well fauored and of ſo young yeares, they ceaſed not to giue him thankes for the good which he had done, ſo that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſomewhat bluſhing at it, forbad them to ſpeake more of it, but to attende their owne affaires, for the Valley béeing ſo repleniſhed with dwellers all of them were not ſound, but for feare or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour were <hi>Argions</hi> claw-backes. Theſe they had to doo with all, and in the end ſubdued them.</p>
               <p>After, wanting a Gouernour, they beſought <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to abide with them, and to take oathes or theyr alleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce towardes him, for ſith that by him, they haue bene reſtored to their auncient Liberties, they thought him to be an able mainteiner of their Franſchiſes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Roſicleer</hi> made them aunſwere, that at the ſuite of <hi>Lyuerba Argion</hi> was ſlaine, and that hée mooued with
<pb facs="tcp:13855:79"/>pittie vpon hir, had enterpriſed if for hir ſake, if therefore, he had deſerued ought, he wiſhed them in reſpect thereof, to make <hi>Lyuerba</hi> miſtreſſe of it, and for the eſtabliſhment of hir poſſeſſion, to match hir with the moſt chiefeſt inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of land and fée amongſt them. This, if they did for his ſake, he ſhoulde account it not onely a ſatiſfaction on their partes for the pleaſure he had done them, but alſo a bond for a further good tourne, if it ſo lye in his power. They debating vpon this matter, were all contented with it, and promiſed all their abilities to doo his commaunde. So among them, there was a Knight called <hi>Brandidonio,</hi> the chiefeſt of all the Valley, a proper and honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Lord of thrée great Caſtles, and beloued of all the Countrey for his bountie and courteſie, him they choſe to marrie with <hi>Liuerba</hi> their Lady. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> very wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this Gentlemans noble diſpoſition, concluded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the marriage, ſo that in foure dayes the Lorde <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didonio</hi> and the faire <hi>Liuerba</hi> were created Lord and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the valley, and in token of obedience, tooke the oath and aſſuraunce of their ſubiectes, where they lyued long time in quietneſſe, their ſubiects as well at eaſe to haue ſuch Gouernours.</p>

                  <p>And ſooth it is, that within a while after <hi>Roſicleers</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, to the ende the ſtraungeneſſe of their deliuerie, might be renued by their poſteritie, and no age ſhuld leaue to ſpeak thereof, they founded an Houſe of Roligion, with a faire Temple, wherein, at the one ſide of the high Alter, they erected a piller of Marble, verie faire and curious, bearing the true counterfaite of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> with the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Argion,</hi> the fréeing of <hi>Lyuerba,</hi> and all that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently followeth in that ſtorie, ſo that long time after, this monument of reſtoring the inhabitaunts, was founde by our age, in the purſuite of aduentures in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. <hi>Brandidonio</hi> and <hi>Lyuerba</hi> héere ruled long time in peace and tranquilitie, and from them deſcended all the Lordes, which ſince haue had the gouernaunce of that Valley.</p>
                  <p>But from thence to followe <hi>Roſicleer</hi> on his waye, the Hiſtorie ſaieth, that with his Squire <hi>Telyo,</hi> he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed ſo long through <hi>Almaine,</hi> that he came to an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the Sea, in a manner direct againſt great <hi>Britaine,</hi> in <hi>Picardie,</hi> where there were two great and faire ſhippes tarieng for the winde, to coaſt ouer into <hi>England. Roſicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> hearing of this in his Inne, went out of his hoſtrie to the hauens mouth, there to ſpeake with the maſter of the ſhippe, for to become a paſſenger, and comming thether, he ſawe manie Knights and ſeruaunts, by lykelihoode of ſome worſhip, paſſe too and fro, which made him thinke it was no Merchaunts veſſell, but yet he entered the ſhip, and there eſpieng two Knights young men, richlye appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>railed,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13855:80"/>and placed in two ſeuerall feates, to whome, the either Knights in the ſhippe, made their obeyſaunce, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his face to haue gone out againe. But the young Knights ſéeing <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and greatlye delyghted in his beautie and comelineſſe of perſonage, called to him, <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> courning towardes them mande is we reuerence, as vnto ſo great eſtates. The Knights receiuing him with as great courteſie, demaunding of him gently what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieman he was, and what he ſought there <hi>Roſicleer</hi> looke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon them, verie ſadly and ſoberly aunſwered. <q>I am come my Lordes from the Valley of the mountaines, and I am deſirous to ſée great <hi>Britaine,</hi> for my affaires which lye in that Countrey, whether as I haue learned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, your ſhippes are prepared, I am therefore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech you, to doo me the pleaſure, as to graunt me paſſage in your companie.</q> They well contented with-all, for that he was a young Gentleman excelling in beautie all thoſe which they had ſéene, tolde him they were willing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, and that if he needed ought vnto this iournes, they would miniſter vnto his wants. <q>
                        <hi>Roſicleer</hi> gaue them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thanks, for this their courteſie: but they demanded far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how he was called, and of what linage he came.</q> To the firſt, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> aunſwered, that his name was <hi>Roſicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and minding to cut off the reſt, he deſired them to ſpare him for the other at that time, and to content themſelues with this, that he now came from the valley of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, wherefore they beléeued, that he was naturallye borne there.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> was enter tained with theſe Lordes, and grewe farther in acquaintaunce with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he knewe the one to be <hi>Bargandel</hi> the <hi>Bohemian</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin germane to the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and eldeſt ſonne to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the other to be the Prince. <hi>Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amandro</hi> brother to the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> both of them of his night kinne.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13855:81"/>
                  <p>The Fortune which linked and conioyned theſe Princes in this amitie, was this. The King of the great <hi>Britaine,</hi> called <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> conſidering that the loſſe of the Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his ſonne, noyſed through his Empire for fiftéene yeares ſpace had ſo appalled the courages of his Knights, that neither feaſts were made, nor turneyes proclaimed, nor anie diſportes vſed with Gentlewomen in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where-by to fire the hearts of young men to the déedes of armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that either all of them ouer-come with griefe, and mourning ſtill for his ſonne, forſooke to weare armour, or els, ſuch as their owne good natures pricked forwards to trie aduentures, departed out of his Realme, in other Regions to become famous, ſo that the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> was verie naked of able Knightes to defend it, whereas before it was beſt knowen in all the world for knighthoode and chiualrie. The King I ſaye, wiſely caſting of theſe things, did not now ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the lacke of his ſonne, as fearing the inconuenience which might enſue by the want of good Souldiers, if anie enimie ſhoulde ariſe, prouided againſt this miſchiefe, on this ſort.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, taking the aduiſe of his counſaile therein, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be proclaimed through euerie Shiere and Markette Towne, that ſuch Knights his ſubiectes, as either were alreadie departed, or now were in minde to departe the realme, and to ſerue in other Princes courtes, ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne to their homes by a daye prefixed in the ſchedule, vppon paine of his high diſpleaſure. This Proclamation diuulged abroade by the ſound of a Trumpet, as many as hoard of it, eyther by their friendes Letters, or by the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſpread in other Countries, reſoutned ſpéedely, ſo that the King in a ſolempne triumph, taking the muſter of his ſpeciall knights founde him-ſelfe ſufficiently furniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Now, the ſecond care was, how to detaine them at home, and for this he deuiſed with his counſell to make a high feaſt in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> with iuſtes and turneys, for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13855:81"/>all knights aduenturous both Engliſhmen and forreiners, and to ordeine ſuch priſes as might inuite noble Princes thether. This thus agréed vppon, the king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> a yeare before that theſe feaſts ſhould beginne, directed his letters to all Princes chriſtened, and other wiſe as farre as <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie,</hi> 
                     <q>certifieng them that he had appointed iuſtes to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at his citie of <hi>London,</hi> and priſes for the beſt dooers, and that thether it ſhould be frée for all knights to come and trie their forces. The price was a maſſie crowne of golde all ſet with pearles and precious ſtones, valued by all mens déeming at the price of a great Citie.</q> The newes héereof by the kings letters ſpread ouer all Countries, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed theſe two Princes lykewiſe, béeing but of young yeares to craue to be made knights by their parents, and to trauaile to wards <hi>England.</hi> So hauing obteined their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, either of them prepared for his iourney, and met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one time in this hauen, neither of them know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other, nor of their intents.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13855:82"/>
                  <p>For the next day the wind blowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very calme, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners hoiſed vp the Sailes, and plied their tackelinges ſo merily, that with greate liking of them all they rode eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet not ſo as they could attaine to the Hauen, in good ſpeede, but that one euening when the moone ſhone bright, and the waues of the Sea were ſtill and quyet, the two knightes with <hi>Roſicleer</hi> betwéene them, leaned ouer the ſides of the ſhippe, reioycing all thrée at the brightneſſe of the ſtarres in the firmament, &amp; at the delicate rumbling, which the winde made in the bottome of the water. This was ſo pleaſaunt vnto them, as that in this contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſpent the thirde parte of the night, about which time they heard the crie of a Gentlewoman as it might be in ſome diſtreſſe. Then they looked about them, and eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lyttle Crayer comming towardes them, in which there was a wilde man, for making a Gyaunt, fierce of countenaunce, and all hairie of bodie, of manners ſauage and cruell, hauing in the one hand a knotted clubbe with pikes at the ende of yron, ſo heauie as a leſſe man coulde not lyft it: and in the other hand haling a faire Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman by the haire, her face all bloudie with the blowes he gaue her, and punches with his féete. The Gyaunt ſtill cryed. Tourne thy Boate thou falfe and traiterous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntreſſe, or I will make thy lyfe to anſwere it mée, in that thou haſt kept me ſo long from it. The Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man neuer aunſwered him, but continually prayed vnto God for ſuccours. This they both heard and ſawe eaſily by Moone light, for the Boate approched to theyr Shippe, and the two other Gentlemen were much abaſhed to ſée ſo wilde a Gyaunt ſo néere vnto them, for they had neuer ſéene his lyke before. But the noble courage of <hi>Roſicleer</hi> coulde not bée ſo countermaunded by the Gyauntes huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to ſuffer ſuch vilany towards any Gentlewoman, and therefore ſetting his foote vpon the ſide of the ſhip, and taking his ſwoord in his hand, he leaped into the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans boate.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:13855:82"/>
                  <p>Nature as it were willing to manifeſt her owne works and to diſcouer the ſecret graces, which ſhée before hadde couered in his comely perſonage. For ſo as if hée had long time experimented the daunger of conflictes, boldely hee tooke vpon him this aduenture. At his firſt comming into the boate he ſtrake not the Gyaunt, but with great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and more diſcreation then was néedefull (but that hée was verye circumſpect, and in all things lowly) hée ſayd vnto the Gyaunt. Leaue of Gyaunt to intreate this Gentlewoman in this ſorte, and waie well, that it is geeat ſhame to a man for to laye his handes vppon a woman. The great Geaunt little reſpecting this courteſie, lefte the Gentlewoman to haue taken vp <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and to haue throwen him into the water, but <hi>Roſicleer</hi> perceiuing him, put his naked ſwoord poinant before him.</p>
                  <p>The Gyaunt raſhly ranne vpon the ſwoord that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a little, and therefore madde angrie at his wound, hée gaue backe, lyfting vp his greate Bat with both his handes to driue at <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> But <hi>Roſicleer</hi> as deſtyned to greater exploytes, watching the blowe, ſtart aſide, and cloſing with the Gyant thruſt his ſword into his guts. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> pulled out the ſword haſtely to haue giuen him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blowe, but the Gyant fell vpon the plankes gaſping for breath: then <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſtept vnto him, and with maine force tumbled him ouer ſhiphoorde, where he lay drenched in the Sea.</p>
                  <p>All this the two Princes beheld, and wondered at the great courage of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> but not a little diſeaſed in that they coulde not helpe him. For when he leaped into the Gentlewomans Boate, they cryed alowde to theyr Knightes to let downe their Shippe boate into the water, but it could not bée, before that the valyaunt youth had drenched the Gyant in the ſea, and that the Gentlewomans boate rode with ſuch ſwiftneſſe as in ſhort time they loſt the ſight of it, with ſo much griefe vnto both theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they might ſcarce ſpeake the one to the other.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13855:83"/>
                  <p>For when they compared together the ſhortneſſe of time in which they inioyed him, and in that ſhort time the great proweſſe which hée had ſhewed before them, they coulde not eaſilye aſcerteine themſelues, whether they had drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſuch thinges, or ſéene them waking. But if ſo bée they were not beguiled either by a dreame, or ſome fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall illuſion, I dare warrant they thought that in regard of that which God hath wrought by him, he could not bée but of a noble eſtate. Well, when there was no hope of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, they haled vp their boat again to kéepe their courſe towardes <hi>Britaine,</hi> hauing hope to méete him there, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appointing with themſelues, if they there failed to go in queſt of him.</p>
                  <p>I may forget to tell you of his Squire <hi>Telyo,</hi> but you may eaſilye thinke of his paines by the loue he bare his Lorde, and I will leaue him to your ſeuerall conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your ſelues in lyke caſes, béeing farre from your Countrie, and farther from your friends whom you haue preferred before your Countrie, the rather to accompanie theſe noble Gentlemen vnto the coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> which in their way ſtill kept on their former dittie, euer talking of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> either commending his good grace, or beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his departure, or blaming their owne miſfortunes, or extolling his ſtrength, and euer the foote of his ſong was, what ſhoulde the ſwiftneſſe of the boate meane, and our ſodeine acquaintaunce? Vnto the depth whereof becauſe they coulde not reach, thereby to quyet themſelues, their ſorrowe redoubled by miſiudging the worſt. In the ende, the Winde was ſo good that it ſet them on lande in the great <hi>Britaine,</hi> not farre from <hi>London,</hi> where the King was reſtaunt. Where as ſoone as they came on ſhoare, before they preſented themſelues to the King, they diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out one of their ſhippes with ſome of their knightes and <hi>Telyo Roſicleers</hi> Squire to coaſt the ſame way which <hi>Roſicleer</hi> was gone, to the ende if Fortune were ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable to bring ſome tidings of him. Afterwards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13855:83"/>with the maieſtie that doth belong to ſo great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, tooke towards the great citie, viewing on euerie ſide the great aſſembly of people, all the fields and high wayes beſides townes &amp; hamlets taken vp for knightes, as well ſtraungers as naturall, and an infinite number of Ladies and Gentlewomen, comming onely to ſée the turnayes. The two Princes ſent two of their knightes before hand to giue vnderſtanding vnto the king of theyr comming. The king glad to haue the preſence of ſo noble Princes at his high feaſt, with a great traine of knights met them without the Citie, and comming towards them, embraced them with great loue. The ſtorie leaueth to recount the words of curteſie which paſſed betwéene them, and ſayth that they entered into the Pallaice with the king, &amp; were lodged in one quarter thereof, himſelfe kéeping his newe gueſts companie that night, and talking with <hi>Liriaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> as concerning his daughter in lawe. At whom he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole ſtate of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> with the appendices as touching that matter, which in ſome reſpect made him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorrowfull to heare of the continual affliction wherwith <hi>Briana</hi> tormented her ſelfe in the moneſtarie of the riuer. And he was as greatlye abaſhed to heare that in <hi>Greece</hi> they knew as little of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio,</hi> as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> he heard of the Prince <hi>Edward.</hi>

                  <hi>ROſicleer</hi> made an ende of the battaile with the Gyant, and the Gentlewoman ſo wel reuenged by his meanes, knéeled downe before him to haue kiſſed his hand, and to giue him hartie thanks for his great friendſhippe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in working her deliuerie from the terrible Gyaunt. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> tooke her vp, and demaunded of her what ſhée was, and by what aduenture ſhe was brought into the Gyaunts hand. The Gentlewoman aunſwered. <q>Knowe my Lorde, that I am named <hi>Calinda,</hi> Daughter to the wiſe man <hi>Artimedoro,</hi> of whome peraduenture you haue heard ſpeaking before this time, inhabiting in an Iſlande not farre from hence in the middeſt of the ſea, which may neuer againſt his will bée ſéene of anie bodie. This wiſe man my Father hauing ſent me on a meſſage in this boate to a friend of his, Lord of an Iland not farre hence, my Fortune was ſuch, that when I retourned by this Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antes Iland, there entering on land for freſh water, I was eſpied by this Gyant who made to me to haue taken me, but I fled towards my boate, which I could not recouer ſo ſoone, but that he entered with me. But as he ſhoued to land, my boat droue backward into the ſtreame, &amp; had loſt the ſight of his Iland. The cruell Gyaunt ſéeing this, and thinking that I had done it by my knowledge, woulde haue killed me, and intreated mée in ſuch ſorte as you ſawe. Nowe as for the lightneſſe of the boat ſir, I beléeue ſayth the Gentlewoman, that it is guided by my Fathers Arte, and that we are on the waye towarde his Ilande. Whereat Gentleman I beſéech you take no thought, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you haue loſt your companie, for I doubt not but that by my fathers cunning you ſhall be ioyned, &amp; then my Father ſhall ſerue you loyally, for the mercie you haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed me.</q>

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:13855:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> much wondered both at the Gentlewomans ſpéech, and at the Gyants crueltie without good occaſion, and eſpecially at the incredible ſwiftneſſe of the boat, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ſea faſter then a birde flieth in the aire, which made him iudge <hi>Artimedoro</hi> to be a verie wiſe man, in that hée had ſo greate authoritie ouer the Sea. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hée reioyced himſelfe vppon hope to ſée the wiſe man, at whome he might demaunde ſome newes as touching Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Father, and <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for that he queſtioned with the Gentlwoman many things as concerning her Father, of whom he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many things.</p>
               <p>Nowe as they talked of theſe thinges, the boate ſtoode ſtill as it had bene ſanded. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> much abaſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at looked on euery ſide what it ſhould be that ſtaied it, and gaged the water with a poale, but he perceiued nothing, wherefore he thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peraduenture vnder the boat in the place there lay ſome Adamant ſtone, of the vertue whereof he had read before times that it draweth yron vnto it, and ſtayeth the Shippes which ſayle ouer it. And as he was much perplexed in his thought, not knowing how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie it, he ſawe before him a little Ilande, the freſheſt and moſt delectable that in his lyfe he had ſéene, and the Boate alreadie faſtened to the banke. Then the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman bad him not to feare, but to come out on land, for the Ilande which he ſawe before him was her fathers Iland.</p>
               <p>This was ſtraunge vnto <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> to ſée the lyquide Sea ſo ſoone conuerted to ſelide earth, but he made not ſtraunge to come on land at her bidding. Where by and by the wiſe man met them, a man by ſéeming verie aged, his bearde all white and reaching to his waſt, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle white rodde in his hande, as ſome token eyther of his honour or profeſſion. The wiſe man for the great pleaſure hée had to ſée <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> ſayde vnto him on this
<pb facs="tcp:13855:85"/>wiſe. <q>Right noble and moſt worthie <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> you are welcome vnto this my Countrie, for by your comming I haue bene more at my hearts eaſe, then during my lyfe I haue béene, and many yeares paſt haue I longed for your preſence. For although I knew for a certeintie that hether you ſhould come, yet the time when I knewe not, which hath hetherto bene concealed from mortall men; and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made knowne to God himſelfe. I knew lykewiſe ſo ſoone as my daughter <hi>Calinda</hi> was borne, that ſhée ſhould be ſet frée from cruell captiuitie and perpetuall diſhonour by you onelye, but the manner howe, was not reuealed withall, onely that it ſhoulde bée when the prouidence of God directed by his will, committed the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to Fortune. Thus may we men for all our cunning neither alter the courſe of thinges appointed by deſtinie, nor yet finde other remedie then is permitted by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God. As this my Daughter coulde neuer haue béene ſaued but onely in that ſame manner as you gaue her ſuccour. The reaſon was, becauſe my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge coulde not wade ſo déepe as to foreſée euerie thing concluded by deſtynies, the ſelfe ſame thing béeing ſubiect vnder the line of deſtinie that I ſhoulde not perceiue it. So my daughter went on land vnto the Gyaunts Iland, which I neither foreſawe to preuent, nor could haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented if I had foreſéene. Yet that which was in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I ſo ruled the boat that it came to your ſhippe, thereby to haue reléefe at your hands for my care: This haue I told you at large the inhabilitie of our cunning againſt the influence of the ſtarres, whereby you may perceiue howe much I am beholding vnto you the rather to make bolde vpon my ſeruice, if in anie reſpect either my arte or my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour may doe you pleaſure.</q>

With this the wiſe man tooke him by the hand, and lead him toward a great and beautifull pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice ſeated vpon the ſhore. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with a curious eye gazed on each parte of the Pallaice, ſo ſcituate in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen Iland, and was neuer content, for in déed, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of the workmanſhip ſurpaſſed farre the crafte of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonrie in our daies.

Sir, ſeeing you haue entered into this diſcourſe, I pray you continue it, for I knew naught as pertaining to this my brother, ſaue that he was loſt in the Sea béeing verie young, &amp; I haue hethertoo thought that he had ben dead: and ſith nothing is hid from your knowledge, I pray you likewiſe ſatiſfie mée in the ſame manner, as concerning the Prince <hi>Edward</hi> my Father, that I may ſéeke him, if there he hope of finding, on this earth.</q>

Hée is nowe in a Countrey, where without knowledge of his Eſtate, he is notwithſtanding, much praiſed for his perſonage, the Region farre diſtant from this our Clymate, that if you put your ſelfe on the waye to ſéeke him, your paine ſhould be infinite, and as I can learne, néedeleſſe, for ere that you paſſe out of this Countrey, he will come to ſéeke you heere. Nowe, as to your demaund touching the Prince <hi>Edwarde,</hi> whome you call your Father; I doo you to wit, that hee was dead before that you were begotten, and that the royall Princeſſe your mother, now deſtitute of an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, ſhall in time recouer hir lawfull huſbande, and you ſhall knowe your Father, for the greateſt and myghtieſt Prince chriſtened. Furthermore, becauſe it is forbidden me to diſcouer of the great ſecrets of God, vntill it be his pleaſure that all men ſhall know it, I may not aunſwere
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13855:86"/>you, but the euent ſhall witneſſe with my Prohecie.</q> Now, will I make readye for your paſſage into <hi>Britaine,</hi> for there muſt be ſhewed the firſt flower of your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> was greatly confuſed in his vnderſtanding, at the words which the wiſe man ſpake, being yet plaine and eaſie, and he able to make Engliſh of euerie worde, but the cauſe was, for that he was vnable to finde out the true ſence, which this diuinitie carried, béeing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt to his former beléefe. So hacking and geſting about it to make lykelihoodes of impoſſibilities, and examining euerie poynt by it ſelfe, yet could he neuer be ſetteled, nor make good conſtruction of it. For his Mother tolde him, that Prince <hi>Edwarde</hi> was his Father, the wiſe man deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the contrarie. And if his Mother knewe his Father, then howe coulde his father be dead ere he was begotten, and howe coulde his Mother recouer hir lawefull. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, béeing dead, and howe coulde his Father become ſuch a Monarch after his deceaſe, and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>Now if he gaue credit to the wiſe man, yet no man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knoweth the childes Father then the mother. So that for reuerence of the wiſe man, and to reconcile his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wordes with the wiſe mannes réede, he framed to himſelfe for that time a newe article of beléefe, that one thing might bée, and not bée. Yet time founde out a better ſolution of this Sophiſme. For this time ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was no reaſon to importunate the wiſe man vppon this matter, it contented him to knowe for a trueth that <hi>Donzel del Febo</hi> his brother was yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and hée gaue him heartie thankes for the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie hée had ſhewed him héerein. But for his voyage into <hi>Englande</hi> hée lefte that to his direction, ſith hée perceiued his meaning therein. The wiſe man ſayde it ſhoulde bee ſo prouided for as beſt beſéemed his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p>The third day after when all things were in a readineſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:87"/>
                  <hi>Artemidoro</hi> brought out of his armorie a rich armour and gaue it to <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> The armour was framed ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as for workmanſhip, coſt, and ſecret vertue, it excelled all that I haue ſéene. It was cloſely wrought, curiouſlye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen, enchaſed with precious ſtones, and aboue all, this efficacie, that it reſiſted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> edge of all mettal, this effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding either from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtones, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> examination of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the forging thereof.

               <p>IN the freſh and pleaſaunt moneth of <hi>May,</hi> when the gréene boughes, and ſwéete ſmelling flowers renewe ioye and gladneſſe in the heartes of young folke, the great Citie of <hi>London</hi> and wide fieldes there-about, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not leſſe couered with armed Knights, then if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hoaſts of <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had thether aſſembled, for the great Feaſts and Iuſtes were ſo diligently publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in euerie Region and Countrey, and the priſes which the King had ſet, were of ſuch valour, that there came thether from diuers farre and ſtraunge landes, ſo manye Knights and Ladies, as that the number of them was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit. Now that that eſpecially drew young princes &amp; men of great name thether, was this. The king <hi>Oliuerio</hi> had a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13855:87"/>daughter named <hi>Oliuia,</hi> the onely inheretrix of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of the age of fourtéene yeares, a beautifull and dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate damzell, as not hir like might be found in all that quarters. For the fame of hir ſingular beautie, thether came manie noble Princes and worthye Knights, to win hir liking, each of them wearing ſo rich and quaint deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that their brauerie in ſhort time exiled the long mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which had continued in great <hi>Britaine.</hi> The myrthe which they made, much delighted the King <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and it ioyed him much to ſée his Court and Countrey ſo well ſtored of Knights and Princes, to whom he gaue honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable entertainment and countenaunce of good wil, as well of his owne ſubiects as ſtraungers, and all were wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it, highly commending of his Court, for magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficenſe and courtefie. The King at this time was a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower, &amp; therefore he ſought much the honor of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe his daughter. But to come to our matter, amongſt the Knights ſtraungers, the two Princes <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamandro,</hi> bare the greateſt ſtroke: next, <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> Prince of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> a young Knight &amp; valiant in armes, alredy enamored vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire princes <hi>Oliuia,</hi> for whom he had ben a long time ſuter in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings Pallaice, preſuming vpon his birth and liuelihood, that ſhe ſhould be graunted vnto him, and as it fell out, the Princeſſe vnderſtoode ſome part of his deſire, but ſhe was of an hautie heart and high minde, making no more account of <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> in reſpect of that demaund, then of another ordinarie Knight, or the refuſe of other. For amongſt all which were alredy come, ſhe thought none merited to be a péere and matche for hir beautie, being (as my Authour ſaieth, ſuch in hir owne conceipte, as if no Prince were worthie of it.) But the truth is, that the blinde Boye ſhooting at randon, had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-reached his marke, as appeared in the ſeconde ſhotte, at the comming in of <hi>Roſicleer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> In the thirde place there came into this Triumph, the Prince of <hi>Irelande</hi> called <hi>Argiles,</hi> and <hi>Don Orgiles</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotlande,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamades</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13855:88"/>king of <hi>Cornewaile,</hi> all thrée vaſſalls and ſubiectes to the King <hi>Oliuerio.</hi> The fourth roome was aſſigned to <hi>Don Brynco.</hi> Prince of <hi>Numidia</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> bringing from his Countrey manie valiant Knights richlie armed, and with them <hi>Albalaxes</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> a Pagen young and luſtie. There came thether alſo two Gyaunts of an admirable height and fierceneſſe, being ſuch a terrour to the poore Communaltie inhabiting the villages néere to <hi>London,</hi> that the poore mans feare made them the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent to commit diuers ryots and other treſpaſſes, before the Feaſts began. This was the ſeuerall countenaunces of the Knights of moſt account, but to make ſhort, ther came beſides, many other knights, both Chriſtians and Pagans, vnder the Kings writ of ſafe-conduct, which himſelfe gaue out; that neuer <hi>England</hi> more flouriſhed of Knightes, nor neuer Nation was like to <hi>England.</hi> But now the firſt day of the Iuſtes, before they ſhould ride to the Tilte, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King <hi>Oliuerio</hi> inuited all the Kings and Princes to dinner in his Pallaics, where they were feaſted royally, &amp; with great melodie. After the Tables taken vp, the Knights went to arme themſelues, and the King conducted by the auncient Lords and Barons of his Court, tooke vp his ſeate in a windowe ouer the Tilt-yard, and vpon a ſcaffolde before him, reared for that purpoſe, he commaunded the priſes to be put, which were diuers: for vnto the Crowne before ſpoken of, he added a cholar of like valure, and many other iewells, able for the honour of attaining them, and the worthineſſe thereof, to animate a daſtard Knight to ſuch an enterpriſe. After this, the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> comming foorth of the great Pallaice with an hundred Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, mounted vpon a ſtately ſcaffolde verie richlye hanged. Among theſe Ladies, there was the Princeſſe <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerina</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Rodoſylua</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> and manie other Ladies, Daughters to the great Lordes of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.</hi>

But the ſcaffoldé being filde with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewomen, there came the Knights in place, moſt of them young and ſhining in thou bright armour.

               <p>After him, <hi>Don Orgiles</hi> prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> came, whom when <hi>Argiles</hi> eſpied, not minding to diſturbe him, he rode vnto the lyſtes ende. <hi>Orgiles</hi> without béeing mooued in his ſaddle caſt downe twelue knights, and then followed his followe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So finding the Tilte emptie by <hi>Siluerios</hi> departing, they praunced forwarde till other Knights came againſt them. And either of them in their turnes before they lefie the lyſtes, ouer-threwe at the leaſt thirtie Knights a péece, ſo blazing their proweſſe by the force they ſhewed, that the King and other behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders chaunged their opinion, as touching <hi>Don Siluerio.</hi> Vpon this, the two Princes glad of that dayes trauayle, and vaunting themſelues before their Miſtreſſes, made roome for others to doo their endeauours. After theſe, the valyaunt and hardie Knightes of the Engliſh Court, came in againſt the ſtraungers of other Countreies, where the Engliſh men ſo behaued themſelues, as that dayes honour was theirs.</p>
               <p>Nowe, as the King was in talke with his Lordes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the glorie which his men had gotten, and euerie man was attentiue to that which was before him, ſodainlye there was heard a great crye amongſt the people, on the backe ſide of the lyſtes, no man knowing what it ment.

The Giant comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Knights to ſtand a ſide, went alone to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe where the King was, there raiſing vp his Beueare, and forcing out a terrible looke, without other reuerence, he ſpake on this wiſe. <q>King <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> I am <hi>Brandagede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Lord of the Ilands <hi>Baleance,</hi> and am hether come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13855:89"/>of the prices which thou haſt appointed for the beſt dooers, I am well knowen in all the Heathen Countrie, for by the power which my Gods haue imparted with mée, there is no mortall man that may gaineſtand my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſaunce, and for that this daye thou ſhalt haue ſome try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of this truth, beholde before the night be ſhut in, there ſhall no Knight of all theſe which are héere kéepe his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, vnleſſe he kéepe himſelfe from mée.</q> And ſo in greate pride, as you may preſume by the courſe of his ſpeach, hée vttered this, and pulled downe his viſour. Then with a greate Speare in his hande, hée tooke the one ende of the pale. This his comming was nothing pleaſaunt to the king, for ſince his ariuall in that kingdome, he had done many outrages to the poore ſubiectes of the lande. And the king feared leaſt the knights of his Court, ſhould not bée able to mainteine their honour againſt him. Nowe this monſtrous Gyant had not ſtayed there long, but that a valiant knight a <hi>Britaine</hi> called <hi>Brandariſtes</hi> made a ſigne vnto him.</p>

The king <hi>Allama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> beholding the kings countenaunce ſadde, and geſſing the cauſe, would néedes aduenture the honour which hée before gayned, vpon the vanquiſh of ſuch a Gyaunt, and taking a freſh horſe with a choyſe Speare from the ratier
<pb facs="tcp:13855:90"/>he rode to <hi>Brandagedeon,</hi> whome the Gyaunt met ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly that <hi>Allamades</hi> laye on the grounde, and <hi>Brandage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> dreſſing himſelfe in his ſaddle paſſed on. By and by <hi>Orgiles</hi> Prince of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſet vppon the Gyaunt, which ſomewhat eſtoniſhed him: but neuertheleſſe <hi>Orgiles</hi> happe for himſelfe was in no other manner then his fellowes. Then came in <hi>Don Argiles</hi> to take <hi>Orgiles</hi> parte, and fiercely encountered the Gyaunt, but to the ſame purpoſe. Nowe was <hi>Don Syluerio</hi> aſhamed before the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> to haue tarried behinde ſo many good knightes, and therefore forcing his courage to pleaſe his Ladie, vpon a light courſer he ranne againſt <hi>Brandagedeon,</hi> and his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was ſo good, that he made <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> to looſe one of his ſtirops and the raines of his bridle, but <hi>Brandage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> quitted this with more then a tollerable vſurie, for he carried him beyond the crouper almoſt a ſpeares length, which diſgrace before his Ladie <hi>Oliuia</hi> made him woode angrie, and willingly would hée haue challenged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, if both leaſure and place had bene conuenient. Not long after the Prince <hi>Bargandel</hi> gathering his forces at the beholding of the Princeſſe <hi>Syluerina,</hi> went to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Gyaunt, either of them being well heated, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly, as ariſing of diuerſe cauſes, but theyr ſtrengthes encreaſed by their heartes, made their ſhockes ſo terrible, as neither parte had great aduantage. The Gyant fell v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the crouper of his horſe, and rode the length of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier ere he might ariſe againe. <hi>Bargandel</hi> fel to the ground, with his horſe vnder him. This made him hang his head, and ſtirred vp his friende <hi>Liriamandro</hi> for his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, which cauſed <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> to embrace the ſaddle howe, himſelfe béeing cleane lifte out of the Saddle by <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> the Gyaunt, and <hi>Liriamandro</hi> laye on the ground to complaine him of his miſhappe before his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres <hi>Rodaſylua.</hi> After theſe there was none left ſo hardie, as to dare encounter <hi>Brandagedeon,</hi> which cauſed the king and other Princes to looke rufully, and the Gyant to beare
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13855:90"/>himſelfe as inſolently, for when there was none lefte, hée lyfte vp his voyce in theſe tearmes. <q>Come foorth, come foorth, ye knightes of the greate <hi>Britaine,</hi> and either knowe what the force of <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> is, or if you dare not appeare, ſende mée the priſes preſently, for to none of the worlde they doe ſo rightly apperteine as to mée, and this ſayeng, he gallopped vp and downe in the place, expecting either ſome Knight or the priſes.</q> The King ſéeing none come to aunſwere his challenge was verie angrye, and woulde haue giuen his beſt towne to haue had a Knight which coulde haue quayled the Gyauntes courage, and for verie griefe he tourned himſelfe from the windowe, till the ſodeine ſhout of the people, cauſed him to looke out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>Then he eſpyed the people flocking together towards one corner of the lyſt, and in the middeſt of them an aged man with a long white beard riding ſoftely on a Mule, and bearing the countenaunce of a verie wiſe man. After him he ſawe a Knight well harneſſed in white armour, richly beſet with precious ſtones, ſo that no man in the place had the lyke, his Helmet had a fine plume, and his horſe the lyke, the pomell of his Saddle of Golde-ſmithes caruing, and the ſeate all imbroudered with golde and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Euery thing belonging to the knight ſo braue and luſtie, that none nowe but gazed on the ſtraunger. After him a good diſtaunce there rode a Gentlewoman an eaſie pace vppon a palfraye, driuing before her a ſumptuous horſe.</p>
               <p>The Gentlewoman comming néere vnto the Pallaice alyghted, and vnlacing her male, ſpread a fayre Tent in the plaine, made all of cloth of golde, with ſuch ſtraunge deuiſes, as neither king nor Keiſar in the world but might haue vouchſafed it for himſelfe. But that which was moſt commendable, was the moſt excellent and braue conceites with néedle worke, which coulde neuer haue béene wrought but by an exquiſite Semſter, as indéede
<pb facs="tcp:13855:91"/>the wiſe <hi>Artemidoro</hi> was the workeman. Now to make ſhort work, when the pauilion was pight, <hi>Artemidoro</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with him vnto the king, ſpake on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>God increaſe thy royall eſtate king of the great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and aduaunce the credit of thy whole Court. Wit you moſt puiſſaunt Prince, that from mine Ilande I am hether come with this young Gentleman, that he may be knighted by your owne hands. And albeit that ſo greate a curteſie neither hée nor I haue merited of your maieſtie, yet vnderſtand worthie king, that for his lignage hée is ſuch a one, as not without reaſon he may craue to be dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed knight of ſo mightie a Prince as you are. And I dare warraunt moreouer that it ſhall not bée ill beſtowed on him, as your ſelfe ſhall teſtifie in ſhort time, although you ſhall not throughly enter into the conſideration of his valour, till that his death bée publiſhed by reporte of his drowning, and that much bloud ſhall bée ſpilte to the greater prayſe of his proweſſe, to the contentation of your perſon, and to the profite of your royall eſtate, and bée it my tale ſéeme incredible, yet I beſéech you to remember it well, for I will auouch the euent as I haue tolde you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne him therefore ſir King in your Court, and beléeue that the time ſhall come wherein you would looſe the beſt parte of your kingdome to haue him néere you. But to the ende, this Storie nowe auerred by mée, maye carrie more authoritie with your worthie perſon. Knowe that this reporter is <hi>Artemidoro,</hi> of whoſe knowledge you haue heard before.</q> For with my ſkill I haue done ſeruice to ſuch great Lordes as you are. <hi>Artemidoro</hi> héere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a reaſonable pauſe, began againe on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sir king, with your maieſties leaue, we haue héere pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a tent in the name of the Gentleman, as a challenge agaynſt all commers, after you haue made him Knight, the firſt, which ſhall vnhorſe him, ſhall inioye his tent, the value whereof ſhall content him for his iourney, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13855:91"/>héere ſtaieng he ſayd. Sir King I haue done.</q> King <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerio</hi> all this while not lending his eares idlely, as to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a winters night, but wayeng euery point, looked vppon <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and well thought that his perſonage might agrée with <hi>Artimedoros</hi> commendation, but yet as halfe in a doubt as touching himſelfe, he made the wiſe man this aunſwere. <q>Aſſuredly <hi>Artemidoro</hi> with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund or anie other which you ſhall require, I am verie glad that you take occaſion of comming to my Court, for by the brute of your fame I haue long time wiſhed to ſée you: but to ſend for you indéed I was neuer minded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as I heare, againſt your will no man may ſpeake w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you. And to make you anſwere, I am in purpoſe to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, as well for your owne ſake, as for this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, whoſe behauiour ſéemeth to be ſuch, as without your report, he commeth ſufficiently commended vnto me, I promiſe you héere to make him knight with mine owne hands, and I beſéech God he proue no worſe then you fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew me, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> and the wiſe man both bowed humbly on their horſe backes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The king badde <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to alyght, which diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from his horſe, aſcended by a payre of Stayres to a little ſcaffolde before the Kings windowe, where knéeling downe in the ſight of the whole multitude, hée receiued the order of knighthood at the kings hands. The king deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded where the young Knight ſhould receiue the ſwoorde, and the wiſe man aunſwered, that he ſhould ſtaie for that till he could conquere it. Then after his duetie done to the king, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> retourned to horſe backe, and with a liuely grace ſo demeaned himſelfe vppon his horſe, as that it well pleaſed the beholders. Now for that which followeth, you muſt intend that the wiſe man vttered his ſpeaches to the king in the audience of the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, many knightes and other compaſſing him about to heare his arraunt, ſo that few or none but were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it. Amongeſt them was <hi>Brandagedeon,</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:13855:92"/>himſelfe within the liſts, as proudly as the Cocke of the game doth in the Cocke pit, when the crauen is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Then hearing that the tent was put for a rewarde to him which could vnhorſe the young knight, when he ſawe time he cried aloud to <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> ſaieng.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In good ſooth new knight, thou bewraieſt thy folly and lacke of experience, when thou ſaweſt me ſtand in this place with my ſpeare in my hand to make that challenge, which ſhall not be in thy power to maintaine ſo ſurely, but that I will be the maſter of thy pauillion, &amp; yet Gods bleſſing on thy heart for bringing ſo faire a Iewell, béeing indéede fitter for me then for thée. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> whoſe courage ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tainted, aunſwered as ſhortly. It ſhal bée thine Gyant if thou winneſt it, and there ſhall no man forbidde thée the poſſeſſion of it if thou ouerthrowe mée.</q> And without more words he tooke a great Speare from the ratter, and tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his horſe head, he rode ſoftly to the place where the iuſtes were kept. In his way thether, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> lyfting vp his eyes to the Scaffold of the Gentlewomen, he ſaws the beautifull <hi>Oliuia</hi> ſtanding directlye againſt his face, excéeding no leſſe the other Gentlewomen in brightneſſe, then the Moone excelleth the ſtarres in a froſtie night. O poore <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> what a looke was that which locked thée from thy reſt, for with her beautie thou waſt wounded at the heart, that albeit in time the ſkinne ouergrew it and the fleſh healed, yet the ſkarre remained: and neuer knight in the worlde loued more loyally then thou diddeſt. For though the ſight was ſhort and the blowe quicke, yet the wounde was déepe and the ſmart cureleſſe. O full many a bolde enterpriſe diddeſt thou achieue, ere thou gainedſt a reaſonable guerdon for thy greate good will. And thou faire Princeſſe being within the hearing of the wiſe mans ſpeach, diddeſt not ſpare to lend thine eares to another mans tale, and ſhine eyes to another mannes brauerie, that thy ſuccours béeing farre from thée, thy heart had not the power to repulſe thy aduerſarie, loue béeing the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13855:92"/>onely occaſion of thy vnreſt. But Lord what alteration both of you felt by the enterchaunge of your lookes, which ſerued likewiſe for meſſengers to tell your tales betwixt you.</p>
               <p>And yet I cannot déeme but that this loue ſo enraged his courage againſt <hi>Brandagedeon,</hi> as otherwiſe I maye thinke hée had not done ſo well. But comming into the place, hée addreſſed himſelfe towardes <hi>Brandagedeon,</hi> both of them now béeing in a readineſſe. The King at this time verie ſorrowfull to ſee the newe Knight in his firſt bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aile to endaunger himſelfe vpon a Gyaunt, and woulde haue talked with <hi>Artemidoro</hi> about this matter, but the wiſe man gaue no anſwere, and to the end not to diſcouer more then was behouefull, he conueyed himſelfe out of the kings ſight. So the king held ſtill his opinion of the young knights weakneſſe, till the iſſue diſproued his thought.</p>
               <p>For in the carryer when the two knightes met in the middeſt of the Tilt-yarde, the Gyants Speare burſt vpon <hi>Roſicleers</hi> head peace, no more moouing him with the blowe, then if hée had ſtroke agaynſt a wall. But <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> hurling at the breaſt of <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> ouerthrewe him and his horſe to the grounde, the horſe in the fall, bruſing the Gyauntes ſhoulder, that his Knightes were faine to carrie him out of the preale, whereat all the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by with great admiration behelde <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> euerye man being a Prophet as his heart gaue him, that <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> would proue the beſt knight in the world, ſéeing that at his firſt encounter in tilt, hauing neuer had to doe with anie knight, before be had ouerthrowen ſo mightie a Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</p>
               <p>The King nowe thought that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the greate corſie which hée had taken at his Knightes diſgrace, and the other Knightes were gladde to haue that huge monſter ridde away, bolder and willinger valyauntly to aduenture themſelues agaynſt
<pb facs="tcp:13855:93"/>
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> then againſt a Gyaunt, and their courage was the more, for the richneſſe of the tent which had inuegled theyr conetous mindes to venture the purchaſe. But as the knightes entered to iuſt with him, he ouerthrew them all, béeing more then an <hi>100.</hi> knightes, without that anie man was able to ſit the ſecond iourney. Then the kings knightes entered, by name <hi>Brandariſtes, Brandidarte, Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> the Princes <hi>Argiles</hi> and <hi>Orgiles, Don Brunio</hi> Prince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> &amp; other, all which he threw downe ſo lightly, as that they might not turne one courſe more that daie. Some held more tacke with him as you ſhall heare héereafter, but by the way the king turning to his Lords, ſpake on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Truely my Lordes, if I had not my ſelfe ſéene the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous déedes of this Knight, I ſhould hardly haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited another, ſo incredible the truth is that one ſhoulde worke ſuch maſteries. I would the iuſts were ended that I might ſée this knight vnarmed, to knowe him, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him as is reaſon.</q> 
                  <q>True it is aunſwered his nobles, and for his valour there is not ſo puiſſaunt a Prince in the world, but that he ſhall haue cauſe to be gladde of his ſeruice.</q> This was a breathing time for <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> but yet I am perſwaded that it was no plaieng time, although no enimie appeared, for he had a greater conflict within his bones, then he profeſſed outwardly, and therefore his heart neither fully aſſured, nor yet in daunger, gaſed vpon the beautie of <hi>Oliuia.</hi> Whereby the fire entering cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the vaynes, waſted and conſumed his fleſh, ſooner then hée felt the flame or coulde thinke of remedie: but better conſidering that hée was within the compaſſe of loues ſegniorie, and that his matter was to bee tryed at the great aſſiſe in loues dominion, he tooke better aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to alter it to an action vpon the caſe of couenaunt againſt his miſtreſſe, the matter ariſing vppon exchaunge of lookes as you haue heard. And for this cauſe he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteyned Sergaunt hope to bée his Lawyer, and féeyd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13855:93"/>diuers others to aſſiſt him, but maſter Deſpaire an old ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had wonne the day of him, had not the whole Bench, and eſpecially the chiefe Iuſtice Deſert, ſtaied vppon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre, which reléeued much <hi>Roſicleers</hi> courage, and made him looke more freſhly, vpon hope to finde out better eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for recouery of his ſute.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Roſicleer</hi> thus plyed his cauſe at the Barre, ſo gentle <hi>Cupide</hi> attended vpon his Miſtreſſe, faithfully ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, and beating into hir head the remembraunce of his actes, and the beautie of his perſonage, that the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of hir deſire being ſet wide open, ſhe viewed hir fill, wiſhing yet to ſée his face, thereby to comfort hir ſelfe, if his viſage were aunſwerable to his vertue. Now <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> with an enuious eye, minding to interrupte this medlea, prouoked <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to the lyſtes, which <hi>Roſicleer</hi> refuſed not. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſhaked ſomewhat in his ſaddle, but yet without daunger of falling, and <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> with his Courſer tumbled to the grounde, ſo euill entreated, as that he was fayne to forſake the lyſtes. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Oliuia</hi> remembring his former importunitie, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing agréeued, thinking therby his ſute to haue ſlaked, the rather to delight in hir new champion.</p>
               <p>By this time, the greater part of the after-noone was ſpent, and verie fewe remained in that place, which durſt ride a courſe with <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> albeit the number of Knights were more than thrée thouſande. But laſt of all <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> willing to proue themſelues vppon the new Knight with great courage, which the ſight of theyr Miſtreſſes cauſed in them, ridde both againſt <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and in theyr waye as they two ſtraue who ſhoulde bée firſt, <hi>Bargandel</hi> giuing the ſpurres to his horſe ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Roſicleer, Bargandel</hi> in his race hit ſo ſtrongly, that his ſpeare flew in peeces, but <hi>Roſicleer</hi> knowing <hi>Bargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> by a deuiſe that he had, and mindefull of his former courteſie, when he came néere him, raiſed vp the ende of his ſpeare, and rode by without touching of <hi>Bargandel.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13855:94"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bargandel</hi> not féeling his aduerſarie thought that hée had miſſed his reſt, and therefore taking another ſpeare for the re-encounter, he rode againe towards <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> did as he did before, whereby he cléerely perceiued the knights entent to be for to ſpare him, and waxing mad angrie he auoyded the place. Preſently ſtepped in the Prince <hi>Lyriamandro,</hi> to whome likewiſe <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelfe as vnto <hi>Bargandel,</hi> albeit himſelfe was well ſtirred with theſe ſhockes. <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> as mad as <hi>Bargandel,</hi> to finde a friende without occaſion, and not knowing his meaning, rode after <hi>Bargandel,</hi> where both of them departed to diſguiſe themſelues thinking to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyle the Knight, if peraduenture he had had ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them. Not long after, the Trumpets blowed the retreate, and the Iuſtes ſhoulde haue ended, when theſe two Knights entered with yeolowe plumes and guylded armour, their horſe trappings all of yeolowe, and parting company, the one of them ranne againſt <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> whom he met ſo ſtrongly, that their ſpeares flew in péeces, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them being vnhorſed, whereat all the people were diſmayed, for no Knight that daye but was ouerthrowen of as many as <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had encountered. But theſe two Knightes rode againe the ſecond time, and as with more cholar, ſo with fiercer ſtomackes they met, that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> tourned with his horſe more then foure paces backwards, hauing much a doo to bring him forward, and the ſtraunge Knight loſt his ſtirrops and fell to the grounde with his horſe ouer him. His companion tooke his roome and ranne twice againſt <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> neither of them looſing their ſeats, but at the thirde encountrie he fell to the grounde as his fellowe did, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> a little diſeaſed in his ſaddle, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered lyghtly. The yeolowe Knights thus ouerthrowen mounted on theyr horſes to reurne the way which he had come, ſore diſpleaſaunt at the little harme they had done vnto <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> but they beſhrewed themſelues for the further attempting of his acquaintaunce, and muſing who it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13855:94"/>ſhoulde be, they remembred themſelues of the young Gentleman <hi>Roſicleer</hi> and of his great proweſſe, whereto themſelues were priuie, thinking that perhappes it might be he, but yet becauſe of his young yeares, they remooued this thought againe, and coulde not well iudge who hée was.</p>
               <p>Then the King commaunded euerye knight to leaue off, at which the noyſe of the inſtruments were hearde ſo lowde, that the whole place rang of the ſounde thereof. <hi>Oliuia</hi> now minded to deſcende with the other Ladyes, wherefore the Knightes and other Princes flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue their attendaunce, among whome, <hi>Roſicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> as forwarde as the beſt in good will, preſented himſelfe vnto his Miſtreſſe, which pleaſed hir not a lyttle. Ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the great Court of the Pallaice, they there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghted, where the King welcommed them, making ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tokens of courteſie to euery one, and comming to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> he deſired him to be at his appointment for that night, for that he had great deſire to ſée him vnarmed. All the reſt gladly obeyed, but <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with his beuere ſhut, requeſted his Maieſtie of pardon, for that it behooued him to diſarme himſelfe in his Tent, till the wiſe man had permitted the contrarie, and ſo ſaieng, he tooke his leaue of the King, entering into his Tent, where he found the wiſe <hi>Artemidoro,</hi> which with two Pages abided his comming.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Roſicleer</hi> was within, they drew the curtaines ſo cloſe, that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> was not ſeene of any, and then hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to vnarme him. After the tables were couered and the boord was furniſhed of al delicacies which <hi>Artemidoro</hi> had thought on, the wiſe man himſelfe being both Cooke &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſitting downe, gaue him heartie thankes for his good prouiſion, but in déede his ſtomacke was full with the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> which had ſo poſſeſſed his entrayles, that the daintie diſhes did not a whit delight his appetite.
<pb facs="tcp:13855:95"/>During this time, the Princes and the Knightes which ſupped with the King, highly ertolled <hi>Roſicleers</hi> worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, each of them being deſirous to knowe him, for they all iudged him to be of high parentage. Thus was this night beſtowed till the day came, wherein they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect freſh matter of diſcourſe and table-talke.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13855:95"/>ouetthrew foure others, that there was not a knight lefie to dare him. At this time he tarried ſometime awayting for newe commers in, but there was none. Onely at a corner of the lyſtes, he ſawe a huge Gyaunt in white ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour vpon a great Courſer, with a hoarce and diſdainfull voyce, commaunding the people to make him roome, and not farre from this Giant, a gentlewoman vpon a palfray in ſtraunge attire much different from ours, hir face was all bedewed with teares as if the Giant had vſed violence towards hir. The Gyant approching to the place where the King ſtoode, made no reuerence: but the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knéeled downe, ſaieng. <q>Know moſt excellent Prince that the renowne of this Court, hath brought me from far Countries hether, chiefly for one cauſe, which the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Gyaunt hath now made two, the originall of them both you ſhall heare nowe vnder one. In the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte of the Eaſt néere vnto the great <hi>Cataya,</hi> there gouerneth a Princeſſe named <hi>Iulia,</hi> as yet but young of peares, but not young for handſomneſſe, héeing nowe as it were in the pride of all her beautie. Hir Father was a right cunning Magitian, inſtructing hir ſo perfectlye in his ſkill, as now therein there are fewe comparable. For ſince his death, ſhe hir ſelfe diuined by hir knowledge that ſhe ſhoulde be priſoner to two Giauntes, and ſhould be inlarged by one Knight, which ſhould fight with them both. For the caſe ſhould ſtand thus, that if hir Knight were vanquiſhed ſhe ſhould as perpetually captiuate be at theyr commaunde, otherwiſe to be at lybertie if they were yelden. Hir ſelfe foreſéeing this, and not finding who hée might be, hath prouided by hir knowledge not to bée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyled: for by hir Arte ſhe made this ſworde, which no Knighte maye euer vnſheath, but onely he which muſt fight with the two Gyants for hir lyhertie, and beſides, the ſworde is ſuch as without it, it were an harde aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but with it the Knight maye boldelye venture on his foes. The ſworde ſhée made and kept, cloſe till time
<pb facs="tcp:13855:96"/>theſe two Giannts by night aſſailing hir, got the Lordſhip of hir perſon, after which time by a truſtie ſeruaunt, ſhe cauſed this ſword to be conuayed vnto me with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, to trauaile for hir ſake in all Princes Courtes, and to ſéeke out the Knight, which could &amp; ſhuld maintain hir quarrell. Three yeares are paſſed ſince I vnder tooke this enterpriſe, and within this thrée moneths landing in an Iland towardes the Weſt, after a long iourney to no purpoſe, it was my fortune to méete this Giant <hi>Candra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marte,</hi> there making him pertaker of my ſute, he requeſted to prooue the aduenture, which I graunted: but when he coulde not drawe it out, beeing couetous of the ſworde, he denied it me againe, ſaieng. For ſo much as you go to the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Court, there to ſéeke ſome Knight, which will doo his deuoure in your miſtreſſe behalfe. No man ſhall attempt the aduenture of the ſworde, but he ſhall firſt trie his forces vpon me, and if by him, I be vanquiſht or ſlaine, let him take the ſword, other wiſe I will with holde it from all men: with this he promiſed to beare me companie, and I of two-euills determined to chooſe the leſſe. Albeit at this inſtaunt I am in greater extremitie, by reaſon of this Gyaunts wrong done to me, and my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe thraldome. This is the neceſſitie which draue me hether, and I am humbly to beſéech your Maieſtie, diſcréet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to weight my cauſe, and to giue remedie by your ſubiects as you beſt may.</q>

                     <hi>Candramarte,</hi> content thy ſelfe, and learne to know vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome thou ſpeakeſt, for I tell thée that King <hi>Oliuerio</hi> hath ſuch Knights in his Court as can make thée amende thy ruſticitie, though thou wert more vntaught then thou art, and for that thou ſhalt not miſtruſt me, beholde I am the laſt and the leaſt of them, yet as one which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſerue him with the moſt.

I ſée well
<pb facs="tcp:13855:97"/>fooliſh Knight thou haſt not bene long acquainted with the burthen of armour, for if thou wert in thy kinde, and hadde well wayed the ſucceſſe of Combatons, thou wouldeſt ſhake euerie ioynt of thée to beholde mée.

But ſéeing thou haſt made choyce thy ſelfe of thy deathſ-man, let vs goe to the battaile, for I would not but that thou ſhouldeſt repent thée of thy fooliſhneſſe. So <hi>Candramarte</hi> broched his horſe with the ſpurres, and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> did the like, which appeaſed the Kings diſpleaſure, that he knewe not howe to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence his for wardneſſe in dooing him pleſure, albeit it may be if he loued <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> that he ſomewhat miſtruſted the euent becauſe the Gyaunt was bigge and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed in armes, and that which was chiefeſt without a ſword, but for remedie thereto, he cauſed a ſworde of his owne to be fetched, wherewith he charged a Knight to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it to <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with this commaundement.

And his ſecond aſſault was with his Fawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon with both his handes fetched compaſſe-wiſe againſt <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> which ſéeing the blow comming with ſuch force forward, lift vp his ſhéeld therein to receiue the ſtroke, but the blow was ſo mightie, that it hewed the ſhéeld aſunder, and deſcending vpon the head péece, made <hi>Roſicleer</hi> abate his lookes &amp; bowe his knées for ſauegard to his fall. The Gyant doubled vpon him, but <hi>Roſicleer</hi> neuer yet daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and recouering his courage almoſt againſt the hare, ſtept aſide, that the Gyants blow was all in vaine, &amp; being ſomewhat out of charitie with the firſt, he determined no more to receiue anie ſuch counterbuffes, ſo that an halfe houre after the combat had laſted the Gyant might neuer hit him one blowe for all that he could doe, For <hi>Roſicleer</hi> was ſo deliuer and quicke that he lightly auoyded them. <hi>Candramarte</hi> ſéeing that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> would not abide by it, chaſed him vp and downe, and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> lead the Gyant a courſe likewiſe: but ſo that the king and all the lookers on iudged that if the battaile ſhould endure long, that the new knight might neuer eſcape the death. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> aſſaied many times to couple with the Gyaunt, and to pull the Fawlchon out of his hands, but <hi>Candramarte</hi> was ſo wily and ſo well aduiſed of the wordes which <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſpake in the beginning of theyr battayle, that he eyther
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13855:98"/>kept himſelfe aloofe off, or in his purſute bare the point of his Fawichon before him: but by this meanes the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle continued to the no little diſcontentment of <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer.</hi> For although his armour was ſuch that no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon might wounde him on his bodie, yet was he ſore bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with trauaile, and his bones were in a manner ſofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the wearineſſe he had felt for the length of the battaile. As the one gaue lightly, ſo the other purſued eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but as I ſay, neuer faſtening a right downe blowe, but as he might ouerthwart and end-long, ſlipping his blows, and in his pride boaſting out theſe and ſuch lyke ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13855:99"/>he fully reſolued either to cloſe with <hi>Candramarte</hi> and wring his weapon from him, or to die vpon him. And wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the opportunitie, when the Fawlchon was ouer the Gyants head, bending his body ſtept within the Gyant, that the Gyaunt had no other reſiſtance but to fell him to the ground with his elbowes. This was no greate miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> for albeit hée was faine to bowe his knées by the thruſt of the Gyants elbowes, yet couching his bodie cloſely, his chaunce was ſo good as to faſten vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the hilts of Quéene <hi>Iulias</hi> Swoord, which hée drewe out, the ſcabberd remaining at the Gyaunts ſide. <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> now béeing ceaſed of the ſwoord ſtept from <hi>Candra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marte,</hi> and called vpon him on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Candramarte</hi> now thou ſhalt ſée who ſhall haue the worſt bargaine of quéene <hi>Iulias</hi> ſwoord, ſith on euen handes we ſhall try this combat, &amp;</q> with this remembring the Gyants former pride, he laid at the gyant ſo thicke and ſo ſure that in ſhort ſpace the bloud ranne from the Gyaunt in more then tenne places, for the ſwoord was excéeding ſharpe, and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> as fell and venimous. Nowe maye you thinke that the mayden ſéeing the Swoorde bared by the Knight, was the gladdeſt woman in the earth, and that the king with other Princes and knights thanked God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, for prouiding <hi>Roſicleer</hi> of a weapon, the ſooner to put ende to the battaile. But the Gyaunt aſſaulted ſo ſore by <hi>Roſicleer</hi> and wounded ſo daungerouſly, began wholy is miſtruſt the Propheſie of the Swoord, and to diſpayre of the victorie, and as in ſuch caſes wan hope is aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: ſo his armour béeing rent, the habergion vnmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and all the riuetring out of order, for that cauſe the Gyant would néedes put the tryall of the challenge vpon one blowe. When this blowe was reached as farre as the Gyaunt might, to haue deſcended with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence vpon <hi>Roſicleers</hi> head péece, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> béeing more quicke then he, met the blowe croſſe wayes that hée cut off both the Gyauntes armes harde by the elbowes. The
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13855:99"/>Gyant thus maimed, yelling out a loathſome crie, reuiled and railed on <hi>Roſicleer</hi> as a man diſtraught, and that which moſt increaſed his paine, was not the torment of his diſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured armes: but either the ſhame of the victorie, or the enuie at <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> but <hi>Roſicleer</hi> making little account of him, tooke the Scabbard from his ſide and ſo lefte him. <hi>Candramarte</hi> ſtill followed blaſpheming and curſing both God and man, and when he coulde neither bee his owne executioner, nor procure another to take the paines, ſware, that for ſparing his death, he woulde deuiſe all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe he might againſt <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and that he would prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his death alſo, if poſſiblie he could inuent the meanes. But truely if I had bene in <hi>Roſicleers</hi> caſe, I ſhoulde not haue béene ſo ſtraunge: ſéeing, that both it ſhoulde haue bene the Gyants laſt requeſt, and ſo little encomberaunce to wardes mée. But the king, Princes, and knightes were ſo toyous of the victorie againſt the Gyaunt, as they bare countenaunce of more ioy outwardly, then they had earſt receiued, euerie one openly deſiring to ſée him vnarmed: but chiefly <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Liriamandro,</hi> being in ſome iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight whom they had found a friend, ere they looked for, ſuppoſing that peraduenture hée was <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> of whome the ſodeine aduenture in the Sea had berefte them. And Quéene <hi>Iulias</hi> Gentlewoman ſéeing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat tryed, and the aduenturer of the Swoord atchieued, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thereby that this was he for whom ſhe had made ſo long a iourney, ſaluted him curteouſlye with his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſade. <q>Now that it is euident noble Knight, that you are the perſon, for whoſe helpe this ſwoorde was framed by my miſtreſſe, I am to certifie that my Ladie gréeteth you by me, and giueth you warning that for her ſake you muſt mainteine the fight with two braue gyants, ioyntly combattant againſt you onely. For this ſhe hath ſent you this ſwoord, the commendation wherof, albeit not vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en lieth in the continuall proofe, which ſhe requeſteth you neuer to forſake, for it will much further you in your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes.
<pb facs="tcp:13855:100"/>Whereto I beſéech you giue credit &amp; deale effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually as ſhe hath hope in you. But now giue me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword that I may beare it to the king and the other Princes, that they may iuſtifie the truth of my former auouch.</q> So <hi>Roſicleer</hi> deliuered the ſwoorde into her handes with the ſheath, which the Gentlewoman brought before the King and the knights then preſent, which all attempted the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, but coulde not doe it, as if the ſcabbard had béene a péece of the ſame mettall whereof the Swoord was, and not ſeuered by edge or toole, which made them all confeſſe, that to the new knight it was propoſed, and to him apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the fight with the two Gyants for the franchiſing of quéene <hi>Iulia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The king redeliuered the ſwoorde into the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans handes, and bad her yéelde it againe to <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> which ſhe did, &amp; taking her leaue of him receiued this for aunſwere. That he recommended himſelfe vnto her good grace, heartely thanking her for ſo great care ouer him, as to prouide a ſword, whereof he had néed, as her ſelfe can witneſſe, and for the reſt he promiſed not to faile her as he was true knight to God and the worlds. The Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with this recommaunde gallopped awaie as faſt as her palfraie might carrie her, the whileſt <hi>Candramartes</hi> knightes remooued their Lorde out of that place into his Tent, whence afterwarde with great griefe for his ſore maime they conuaied him into his Iland, wherein hauing ſetled himſelfe, as mindfull of his oath, he neuer lefte from imagining of craftie meanes, and coining new pollicies to bring <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to the death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Candramarte</hi> was carried into his Tent, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> mounting vpon his horſe, tooke a greate Speare in his hande, and ſtoode at the liſts ende, thinking that ſome knight would come againſt him, but they were all ſo ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the ſight of this laſt victorie, that neuer a Knight ſhewed himſelfe. Wherefore the King commaunded to ſound the Trumpet to procéede vnto the diſpoſing of the

               <p>She with much ſhamefaſtneſſe which her couloured chéekes bewrayed, accepted the charge, and taking the crowne with the choller in her hande, ſhe cauſed the newe Knight to hée called before her, who burning in loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her, no leſſe then ſhée was ſeruent in lyking towardes him, diſmounted at the firſt call, and betwéene the two Princes <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Liriamandro</hi> mounted vp the Scaffolde where the beautifull Princeſſe was, before whome he appeared with greater feare ariſing of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit concerning his indignitie, then earſt attached him in the fight with <hi>Candramarte</hi> without a weapon.</p>
               <p>The two Princes comming before <hi>Oliuia,</hi> made their humble obeyſaunce, and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> knéeled downe. The Princeſſe with a good grace bending to euery one of them ſpake to <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> 
                  <q>You knowe new knight what charge the king my Father hath layde vpon mée, although farre more honourable then I am able to ſuſteine, yet by mée aſſumed, neither to reſiſt his will nor yet againſt my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, for it is commendable of it ſelfe to be a commender of vertue, and neuer too much may I commend it. The charge is, that with mine owne handes I ſhoulde diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute theſe priſes according as mine owne fancie leadeth mée to déeme of euerie mans trauaile and valiauncie. The deliuerye of theſe Iewelles, were nothing harde nor doubtfull, but the diſpoſing more then harde, becauſe it pertayneth to iudgement in déedes armes, wherevnto my ſexe is not ſufficiently abled. Neuertheleſſe ſir knight as your paines haue bene greateſt, thereto witneſſeth this whole multitude: ſo your proweſſe in my iudgement, ſo much aſſureth on your parte, that without dooing wrong

For this, if I know to doe right vnto whome I ought, it is méete that you doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye your Helmet, and ſith your déedes diſcouer who you are, it is no reaſon that you couer your ſelfe anie longer.</q> When the Princeſſe had thus ſayde, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> not hauing power to excuſe himſelfe, vnlaced his Helmet, which bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put off, his face ſéemed ſo beautifull by the heate and trauaile of the armour, which rayſed a freſh redde in his chéekes, that it ſtroke them all in amaze, and none of thoſe which ſawe him, conſidering his faireneſſe with his age, but rather iudged him an Angell of heauen, then a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall knight.</p>
               <p>When the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> ſawe him ſo fayre, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loue had made a wracke in the moſt ſecret parte of her heart by the viewe of his Knighthoode, ſo nowe the ſame breach being made wider by the ſecond aſſault in his beautifull lookes, loue entered with banner diſplayed, and finding no reſiſtance, tooke poſſeſſion wholy of her heart, and ſwore all that he found to be his true priſoners. Thus loſt ſhe her libertie, and yet with the beſt courage that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might, ſhe framed out a countenaunce of great frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You needed not by your fauour ſir knight, to haue ben a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed ſhamed of your face, and yet ſuch as it is, it is farre inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to your manhood, but this is beyond the compaſſe of my commiſſion, nowe come you néere and receiue at my hands the glory of your worthineſſe, which your good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune yéeldeth you.</q> 
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> approching very néere, knéeled downe, &amp; the Princeſſe put the choler about his necke, and the crowne vpon his head. When the Princeſſe had ſo done with a little ſtay betwéene, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> tooke the crowne from his owne head, and as he was on his knées, ſayde vnto the Princeſſe <q>Moſt excellent Princeſſe, for the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne grace you haue ſhewed me, I will remaine yours hence foorth to ſerue you loyallye, as a poore recompence

But as againe to the Princeſſe in all this ſubiection to loue &amp; his lawes, her honeſtie is chiefly to be noted, which for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both the remedie was aboue her capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, &amp; the paine likely to ouercome her patience: yet bare out the bruntes thereof in ſuch modeſtie rather by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce then ſtriuing withall, that neither coulde <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> euer aſſure himſelfe of her liking, nor anie of her ſeruaunts wring it out by the manner of her diſeaſe. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> was ſo cloſe, which in him was the occaſion of farther trouble, for coueting to bée alone the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce himſelfe, and to enter more narrowly into the ſearch of his owne abilitie with the likelyhoode of his ſute, hée ſtumbled as in a blinde way vpon two blockes, ſo placed as that if he auoided the one, he muſt néedes hit his ſhinne againſt the other: For this was one. If he reauealed not his griefe or not made her priuie to his eſtate, there was naught to preferre him before another knight.

In this conflict hee did nothing but afflict himſelfe, neither daring to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his maladie, nor minded to diſſemble it altogether, by ſo much the more in worſe caſe then the Princeſſe was, as the infirmitie of her ſexe did leſſen her paine by yeelding at the firſt, and the magnanimitie of his courage to haue the maſterie, did in the end make the déeper impreſſion in his fleſh, like as in nature the hardeſt fight is betwéene the hardieſt, and ſooner ſhall the cannon ſhot deface the high towers, then breake through a rampier of wooll or flaxe, and ſo the iſſue prooued in him. But béeing one daye with the king and the other noble Princes in the great pallaice to beguile his ſolempne conceits which ouercame his nights

                  <q>O ſir knight, Fortune, Fortune hath frowned on mée, ſo that better welcome ſhould be the death then the daye lyght. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> yet requeſted her to ſpeake more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to tell wherein Fortune had wrought her ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite. I will gladly ſayth ſhe, and for truth ſir knight I am a Gentlewoman belonging to the Quéeene of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> which ſent mee with a Brother of mine a verie valyaunt Knight hether, to bring certeine Iewells for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> daughter to the King <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and for the Princeſſe <hi>Rodaſylua</hi> her owne Daughter. Now our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe was ſuch, that entering the ſhoare, wee hit vppon a great and diueliſh Gyant, who examining vs whether we went and what we carried in our fardle, becauſe my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made no aunſwere flew him, and putting mée from me palfraie, tooke from me my horſe and my fardle, ouer and beſides with this commaund, to go vnto the king <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerio</hi> and to the knights of his court, there to record my complaint againſt him. Thus haue I my Lord ſatiſfied your requeſt, now God be with you, for I will on to craue ſome remedie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>With this the Gentlewoman parted from them, but <hi>Roſicleer</hi> calling to her ſayde. <q>Gentlewoman, ſo it is that my arrant is for the ſame purpoſe to fight with the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, for the like treſpaſſe by him committed agaynſt this Gentlewoman héere with mée. If you will returne with vs, we ſhall be verie glad thereof, and by Gods helpe I ſhall well qwell that Gyants inſoleucie. What ſayde the
<pb facs="tcp:13855:106"/>Gentlewoman, doe you purpoſe alone to fight with the Gyaunt. I indéede aunſwered <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and haue hope to reuenge this Gentlewoman and your brother. God mate well giue you power ſo to do, it it pleaſe him ſaid the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, but in reſpect of the Gyauntes ſtrength it will not ſinke into my breſt that <hi>100.</hi> ſuch knights as you are can chaſtiſe him. Well ſayd <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> if you will go with mée, you may at leaſure when you ſee the euent deliverate what to doe. If ye will not fare you well, for leſſe ſhall bée your hope of remedie in kéeping your waye as you nowe doe.</q> 
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> helde on, and the Gentlewoman viewing his goodly perſonage, thereby perſwading her ſelfe that it were but little loſſe to turne backe with him, determined to proue his good Fortune. And as ſhe was not fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in her thought, ſhe ſpake on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Be not diſpleaſed with me, but for the loue of God faire knight haue ſome greater regard of your owne ſafetie, not to caſt your-ſelfe away for the recouerie of my damage, it is no great matter for me to take ſome paines in going with you: but it will be ſome griefe to returne againe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with a freſh complaint of a new murther. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for God ſake let the Gyant alone. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſayde, I may not, but ſeeing you haue promiſed your companie, get vp behinde my Squire, and caſt your care vpon God, which will preuaile for your eaſe, as beſt ſhall lyke him.</q> So they foure trauayled towardes the place where the Gyants abiding was, and comming neere vnto the ſhoare, they ſawe him hard by the water, where he ſate vppon a great horſe, and more then thirtie knightes in a Crayer not farre off, as if they purpoſed to boord a tall ſhip. which was on floate in the Sea halfe a mile. <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> by and by knew <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to be the new knight, by the rich armour he bare, the ſelfe ſame being worne by him in the iuſts, wherein he was hurled to grounde, for which cauſe preuenting <hi>Roſicleers</hi> ſalutation, with a lowde and hollow voyce he cried vnto him <q>Now ſir knight may I magnifie
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13855:106"/>my Gods for that I haue thée in ſuch a place wher I may be auenged of thée at my pleaſure for the deſpite thou haſt done me, and all the world ſhall not raunſome thée from my hands. God of heauen ſhall be my borrow aunſwered <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> which alſo ſhal correct thy wickedneſſe and tread vnder foote thy intollerable pride and arragancie. But to tell thée my meſſage, I challenge thée for to make ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto theſe gentlewomen of the wrong thou haſt done them, or to prepare thy ſelfe to mainteine thy miichiefe.</q> 
                  <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> ſpake no word, but ſignified his meaning by his demeanour, for be tourned his horſe head in great rage and tooke a beauy ſpeare with him, the other vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ſigne, did as much. This firſt iourney brake their ſtaues, and made them trie the reſt of the battaile on foote. The Gyant being cleane vnhorſed, &amp; <hi>Roſicleers</hi> horſe giuing backe, ſo that he ruſht againſt the ground, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe was diuers and vnequall in the riders themſelues. For <hi>Roſicleer</hi> keeping his ſaddle ſelt no harme in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; the Gyant throwen violently to the earth, was well ſhaken with the fall.</p>
               <p>But the combate is not yet ended, for <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> béeing ſtrong and mightie helde <hi>Roſicleer</hi> verie harde, as indéede it could not be otherwiſe, for betwixt them alone y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fight continued two houres, all the meane time neyther part giuing ouer; nor making anie ſemblaunce of diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiture. In the end the knight hauing treble aduantage ouer the Gyaunt, firſt the Queene <hi>Iulias</hi> ſwoord which hit ſore: ſecondly in <hi>Artemidoros</hi> harnes which held out the force of the Gyants weapon: and thirdly the nimbleneſſe of his bodie readie both to aſſaile ſtronglys and to decline as lightly from the others blow, by which meanes hauing made a wide hole in the Gyants armour he wounded the Gyant at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The execution of this challenge to ſo little diſpleaſure on <hi>Roſicleers</hi> parte, made <hi>Arinda</hi> thinke it long till ſhee ſhoulde blaſe it at home in the monaſterys of the Riuer,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:107"/>but her pleaſure was ſoone ouercaſt, for there was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered vnto her a cup of colde water in ſtéede of better ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to alay her thirſt. All this happening beyond her expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by that Gyants knights, which ſéeing their maſter at ſuch an exigent, although in no euident appearaunce of his ende, in greate furie came to lande, and at once all of them with theyr ſwoords fell vpon <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> This was no euen match, thirtie Knights and a Gyant to ſet vpon one ſilly knight, before almoſt tired with two houres battaile againſt the Gyant. But what thing may reſiſt Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce? The Gyants knights laide on with ſuch coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that it reuiued the Gyaunt, for they were all choſen Knightes, but I doubt not but that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> beſturred himſelfe, for ſo many as he met, he either maymed, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, flewe, or threwe to grounde. And béeing ouer-awed by number and freſh onſettes, he was fayne for defence to his backe, to withdrawe himſelfe into the Sea, there to ſtand in the water and receiue theyr blowes before him.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Telyo</hi> his Squire and <hi>Arinda</hi> the <hi>Hungarian</hi> ſéeing him forced to this extremitie were very woe begon, but the Gentlewoman <hi>Luſitanian</hi> as deſperate of all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours by his meanes, gallopped from thence vpon her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraie which ſtoode by the ſhoare, no leſſe complaining the daunger wherein ſhée left this good Knight, then recure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe lamenting the vniuſt death of her brother. As ſhe had ridde ſome part of her way towards <hi>Oliuerios</hi> court, there were two knights in her iudgement verie luſtie and armed at all points which made all the haſt they might to get néer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Gentlewoman comming within the hearing of them, and minding to preuent other queſtions, cryed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a farre off. <q>For the paſſion of God my good Lords, if all nobleneſſe and vertue be not cleane buried in you, make haſt to ſuccour a Knight the beſt in the world, which is now enuiroued with his enimies being about
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13855:107"/>thirtie knights beſides a Gyant.</q> The two knightes with theſe newes poſted a maine, &amp; by the ſame way which the Gentlewoman came, in ſhort time got a ſight of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> which at that time ſtoode in the water againſt. <hi>11.</hi> or. <hi>12.</hi> of them, for ſo many were left on liue of thirtie perſons, thoſe alſo which then liued beeing well nurtured by <hi>Roſicleers</hi> diſcipline, that they would preaſe vppon him without good warrantiſe.</p>
               <p>Now vy that time that the two knightes came, <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> had killed more then twentie, leauing a paſſage ſo well trode as they might eaſily trace out his foote ſteppes. At their firſt breaking in among the Gyants knights, they burſt their ſtaues vpon two of them, ouerthrowing them, and then drawing their ſwoordes ſtrake ſo luſtely that the aſſaylants were gladde to leaue <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and to defend themſelues againſt the two knightes. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> hauing ſo good helpe at hande, although he was ſtirred with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall heate of the foote battaile, woulde néedes be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie player in the laſt act of this Tragedie, and therefore choſe out <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> to deale withall, and with his ſharpe ſwoord gaue him ſo fierce a ſtoccado, that the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells trayled after the weapon, and the Gyant fell downe. Now béeing thus put in poſſeſſion of his deſire, he came to the two knights, vttering theſe or ſuch like ſpéeches.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I beſéech you noble knights to let me knowe at whoſe handes I haue receiued ſo good maintenaunce, that I may the better giue you thankes according to the ſtate of your degrée, and your demerites towardes mée.

You are not to thanke vs, for your owne hand had wrought your eſcape before our comming, but neuertheleſſe at your requeſt we are content to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our ſelues, &amp;</q> ſtreight way they vnlaced their helmets, whereby <hi>Roſicleer</hi> knew them, the one to bee <hi>Bargendel,</hi> and the other <hi>Liriamandro,</hi> his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as this talke was interrupted by the comming of the two Gentlewomen and <hi>Telyo Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleers</hi> ſquire, to demaund leaue of ſearch in the Gyaunts beate for the coffer and fardle which had bene taken from them, ſo after the Gentlewoman with leaue obteined, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for to ſearch: theſe thrée knightes beganne a déepe conſultation of their owne affaires, and what they ought to doe. <hi>Bargandel</hi> ſpake firſt in this wiſe. <q>We haue this moneth and more leitered verie idlely in king <hi>Oliuerios</hi> Court, without exerciſe of armes or armour, therefore it wer not miſ-beſéeming vs knights, if we ſhuld for a time forbeare our returne, to practiſe déedes of armes, that our good name &amp; honour may inlarge our credit in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and be a meanes of the ſure ſetling of our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this land, and the rather thereto am I lead, for that I will not feare anie diſworſhip or vanquiſh in your companie.

               </p>
               <p>By this time the Gentlewomen returned with their owne carriage, and what with the length of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, and other accidents, the daye was ſo farre ſhutte in, that beeing verie darke they were conſtrained alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to tourne into a kéepers houſe néere at hand, where they were welcome at ſuch warning. For hée knewe the three knightes at the greate feaſtes, wherefore hée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteined
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13855:108"/>them as honourably as he might. That night not hauing wherewith otherwiſe to buſie themſelues, and the opportunitie of the bearers, putting them in minde of their miſtreſſes, they gaue themſelues to enditing euerie man of ſeuerall letters vnto his loue and Ladie. <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Liriamandro</hi> deliuered theirs vnto the Gentlewoman of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> but the other not willing to make manifeſt his choyce for that time, tooke <hi>Arinda</hi> a letter cloſely to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> his good Ladie, &amp; afterwards amongeſt other talke he required to ſee the coffer of iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells which the Princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> ſent to <hi>Oliuia,</hi> as if it had bene onely to haue ſeene the riches therof, <hi>Arinda</hi> gaue him the coffer, which he opened, and toſſing vp and downe as if to ſée all the iewells, he ſecretly conuaied his letter to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuia,</hi> vnder all the papers, and redeliuered the coffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſuſpect.</p>
               <p>Well to make an end, the talke had an end, &amp; when the reſt went to their reſt, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> fell into his ordinarie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, driuing in his thought the whole order of the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and her receit, with her manner of turning ouer the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to view euery iewell, this being but the firſt aſſay of the humour, but when his fancie brought him to the finding of the Letter, Lord what a fight he ſuſteined, for the better vnderſtanding whereof, you muſt imagine a young ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler but lately entered into ſchoole points, ouer ſeeing of his theame, before he bring it to the reuiewe of his Shoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, and beléeue mée in farre greater double hung <hi>Roſicleer</hi> of his Ladies liking, then the boye doth of his maiſters.

And beginning to recken a freſh after this comfort, hée ſtayed himſelfe vppon theſe two pointes, firſt, that ſith he was diſeaſed, his remedie muſt begin by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his griefe knowen: ſecond, that his conſcience tolde him there was nothing in the letter, the truth whereof hée durſt not auouch as concerning either his owne perſon, or the Princeſſes, and this was his nightes reſt as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

               <p>Sire dayes theſe thrée knights rode together with-out happening vpon any thing worthy the recitall. The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day in their waye they ſawe a farre off a Knight ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tall and bigge made vppon a faire ſtéede by ſéeming a Knight of great account. There followed him two Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the one bearing his launce, the other his helmet, for the heate of the day had made him vayle his head-péece to put on a lyght hat of Taffeta, and comming néere, they ſawe that he was of a good countenaunce, ſomewhat of coulour duſkie and blacke, but in making both manlike and of good proportion, his ioynts well knit, and ſomewhat large withall, which foreſhewed great likelihood of ſtrength and courage. This knight ſtraunger firſt ſaluting theſe thrée Knights riding by, ſpake vnto them thus.</p>
               <p>Tell me my Lordes I praye you, whether you be of King <hi>Oliuerios</hi> Court or no? <hi>Bargandel</hi> aunſwered him. Truly we are if we liſt, and ſo long as our lyking laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but wherefore demaund you this? I will tell you ſayd the Knight. Sooth it is, that I am a <hi>Tartarian,</hi> borne in that parte of <hi>Tartarie</hi> which bordereth vppon <hi>Europe,</hi> and trauayling to ſéeke aduentures, I was caſt by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of the Sea, vppon the Countrey of <hi>Zealand,</hi> where I hearde, that manye Knightes ſhoulde aſſemble in this Realme, at a great Feaſt and Iuſtes proclaymed by the King, with a ſafe conduct warraunted out vnder his owne ſignet, for all Knightes Chriſtians and Pagans or of all Nations elſe beſides whatſoeuer, thether to come and prooue theyr valour. <q>I am as I ſaye, a wandring Knight, and haue no other erraunt but to ſée ſuch good Knightes, and to trye my ſelfe amongeſt them. Vppon the reporte héereof, as ſoone as my ſhippe was rigged,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:110"/>and trimmed, and that the winde ſerued for my purpoſe, I entered in my ſhippe to arriue in this lande. Nowe, whether that the waye long and daungerous by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of my Pylot ſhut me from my hope, or that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters miſtooke the daye, or rather knewe it not. Since my comming to lande, I haue in manie places bene aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that the Feaſtes are long agone ended, and that the moſt parte of the Knightes haue taken ſhipping, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted into their Countreyes, notwithſtanding, leauing behinde them ſuch a good memorie in the mouthes of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man, as much it grieueth me to haue loſt my labour. For this cauſe laſt remembred, I am in purpoſe for one monethes ſpace to ride through this lande, and to deale with all Knightes commers, to prooue whether their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite be not aboue theyr deſertes: wherevnto I haue ſette this condition, that if any of them diſmount me or make me yéelde, that then I muſt faithfully accompliſh all that which the vanquiſher ſhall will mée. But if I vnhorſe anye of them, or take anye of them priſoners, then the vanquiſhed, ſhall commende mée to the King <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> and make offer of his or theyr lyues and goodes, at his courteſie as a ſimple token of my great good will towards him. Since this determination thrée dayes haue I iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed in this lande, and I haue encountered ten knights whome I haue ſent accordinglye to King <hi>Oliuerio.</hi> And my Lordes, whether are you retaining to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Courte or no, for if you be, I maye not breake my vowe, although by your ſemblaunce and riding, you ſhewe to me as the beſt Knightes, which I haue ſéene in my lyfe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſayde the Knight ſtraunger, and the other thrée Knightes were eaſelye brought to the allowing of the conditions. Wherefore <hi>Bargandel</hi> which hadde vndertaken to aunſwere, ſayde. <q>Syr Knight, wée thanke you for the large recounte you haue made vnto vs of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13855:110"/>your hether comming, and as to your ouer-late arriuall, and the conditions ſet to the Tilte, albeit I maye not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke them being ſo equall, yet for my parte, I aunſwere, and for theſe Knightes, that we would not gladlye deale with you vppon ſo lyght occaſion, for rather will we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſtraunge Knightes then in anye wiſe be an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce vnto them, but ſith it is your earneſt ſute, &amp; that therein we ſhall doo you ſeruice, we will not refuſe you, and by the leaue of theſe my Lordes and fellowes, my ſelfe will be the formoſt. But by God ſir Knight, there is the Ladie <hi>Syluerina</hi> in the Engliſh Courte, and if I faile not of my purpoſe, I will make you kiſſe hir white handes, ere you bée manye dayes elder. But <hi>Bargandel</hi> fayled in déede of his purpoſe, for though hée was a verye valyaunt Knight, yet was hée but young, and the <hi>Tartarian</hi> was both mightie and well exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the <hi>Tartarian</hi> had buckeled on his helme, and <hi>Bargandel</hi> had obtained leaue of his fellowes to bée the firſt in this aduenture, either of them clapped their ſpurs to the Horſe ſides, and their encountrye was ſuch, that <hi>Bargandel</hi> brake his ſpeare in ſmall ſhiuers in the ſhielde of his enemie, cauſing the <hi>Tartarian</hi> to looſe the raynes, and to wreathe ſome-what in his ſaddle. But the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> ouerthrewe <hi>Bargandel</hi> horſe and man to the grounde, and with the tourne to recouer the raynes, dreſſed himſelfe in his ſaddle, paſſing forth gallantly, while <hi>Bargandel</hi> laye on the ground verie angrie and deſirous to haue had the Combat with the ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> and <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> much wondred at theyr ſhockes, <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> then tooke the nexte tourne, and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> becauſe the ſtraunger wanted a ſpeare, ſent his owne ſtaffe vnto him, which peraduenture if hée coulde haue foreſeene the euente, hée woulde not haue done, for by it <hi>Liriamandro</hi> was hurled to grounde,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:111"/>and the <hi>Tartarian</hi> almoſt vnhorſed, his ſtirroppes béeing broke, and himſelfe caſt vppon the arſon of his ſaddle. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> Knight was much abaſhed at the great force of theſe two Knights, for he had not thought to haue met two ſo ſtrong Knightes in all this lande, and when there remayned none but one Knight, and hee lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with-out a ſtaffe to iuſte with-all, hée came to this one, and bidde the baſe to the ſworde playe in theſe tearmes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Sir Knight, ſith both of vs want ſpeares to iuſte with all, it ſhall be well to make vp this lack with our ſwords, that you maye reuenge the ſhame of your companions, or elſe goe with them for companie, and all thrée preſent your ſelues priſoners to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King your Lord. Whoſe Court not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I ſhall highlye commende of, for the great vertue, whereof my ſelfe hath had proofe ſufficientlye in your fellowes. Aſſuredlye ſir Knight (ſayd this odde man, which was <hi>Roſicleer</hi>) were it not for the duetie which I owe to my companions, and for that you ſhould ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite their courteſies if you ſhoulde leaue me ſcot-frée to ſcorne at their miſhappes, I woulde that this Combatte with ſwordes ſhoulde be excuſed, for that I am not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to fight for ſo ſmall a cauſe, but ſith that both my companions challenge this at my handes, and that it is a poynt of cowardlyneſſe to leaue the combatte, and alſo that you will not haue vs to breake companies, I condiſcende to your deuice with this <hi>Prouiſo,</hi> that if by good Fortune I ouercome you, my companions ſhall be freed from your charge, and you ſhall goe in their roomes to kiſſe the King of <hi>Englands</hi> hande, as I am ſure it will doo you good to haue acquaintaunce with his grace. I am well pleaſed héere-with aunſwered the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> and ſo ſaieng, he drewe out a fine ſworde, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> lykewiſe drawing his.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus beganne the braue Combatte in which they continued a long time, no aduauntage béeing eſpyed on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13855:111"/>either parte by the beholders, what was within them, themſelues beſt knewe. But <hi>Roſicleer</hi> rather delighted then afraide at his enimies courage, deuiſed by himſelfe how to winne that valyaunt Knight for friende, and to leaue the Combatte, for vppon ſo flender a quarrell, hée thought the hazarde would be too great. Marrie for all that he did his beſt, for when he felt the ſtrong buffettes, hée coulde not but yéelde the like. The <hi>Tartarian</hi> Knight bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in rage, rather to haue the maſterie ouer ſo valyaunt Knights, rather then for any ill will he bare to <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> compaſſed how by maine force to ſubdue his aduerſarie, and in this thought be ſtrake ſo furiouſlye, that with his charge and the others aunſwere, the noyſe was ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and great withall, that it was hearde vppon the toppe of hilles, as the ſhot of Artillerie. When the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Knight was ſo well heated as you haue hearde, he draue a blowe with both his handes, full at <hi>Roſicleers</hi> head, which lighting vpon the fine and inchaunted helmet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding depriued <hi>Roſicleer</hi> of his eye ſight, and infée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his hearing at that time. But <hi>Roſicleer</hi> coulde not ſo ſoone forget it, and therefore while it was freſh in his remembraunce, he reſtored the like blowe, which in the deſcending, miſſed the <hi>Tartarians</hi> creaſt otherwiſe it had put him in daunger, but ſtyding vppon his ſhoulder, it was ſo heaue, that it made the <hi>Tartarian</hi> ſtoupe to his horſe backe. The nexte daungerous blowe which the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> gaue, made <hi>Roſicleer</hi> boowe vnto his ſaddle both the ſworde and the raynes fallyng from him. <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Lyriamandro</hi> ſtanding by, fell there-with into a ſtraunge admiration of the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> in that hée not onely kepte <hi>Roſicleer</hi> playe, but put him to his trumpes, and by this time, I thinke their deſire to fight with him, was well abated, ſéeing they knewe nowe howe well hée coulde handle his weapon. And <hi>Roſicleer</hi> hauing gotte greater courage through the griefe of his wounde, kepte no more his ſeate, but riſing in his ſtirroppes and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
<pb facs="tcp:13855:112"/>his ſworde, which was faſtened with a little chain vnto his ſaddle bowe, he hit the ſtrong <hi>Tartarian</hi> ſo great a blowe, that the bloud guſhed out both at his eares and noſtrells, and he laye for dead vpon the crouper, the horſe carieng him about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field til he reuiued. After not without ſome abaſhment, as one come out of another worlde: the <hi>Tartarian</hi> when he felte the bould iſſuing in ſuch meaſure, lifte vp his hande, and calling for helpe on his Gods, ſaieng.</p>
               <p>Aſſiſt me O my Gods againſt this fell knight, for if I tarrie more of theſe blowes, my life ſhall ſoone be ended. And when he had ſo ſayd, as purpoſed to make an end of the fraye, he tooke his ſworde with both his handes, and with all his force following the blowe, he ſmote <hi>Roſicleer</hi> vppon the helmet, to no great harme on his bodie, but the waight thereof aſtoniſhed him, as much as if a Tower had fallen vpon him, whereat <hi>Roſicleer</hi> waxed madde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, and not remembring that which before he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated, as to ende the battaile in quietneſſe, hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed the treſpaſſe, with treble damage to the <hi>Tartarian.</hi> For albeit the <hi>Tartarian</hi> might well be reckoned among the moſt famous Knights of elder time, being couered with a helmet ſo well tempered as anye Prince might haue, yet liuing in that age, and encountering ſuch Knightes, his roome was but nexte the beſt. And when hée ſawe that terrible blowe ouer his head, hée coulde haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a whole Mountayne betwéene him and it.</p>
               <p>But there néeded no ſuch impoſſible meanes to auoyde this miſfortune: for it was prouided by the diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God that this noble Knight ſhould dye a Chriſtian, and that great friendſhippe ſhoulde growe betwéene theſe thrée Knightes, and therefore God ſo directed <hi>Roſicleers</hi> hande, that it fell not right, but glauncing downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſhoulder, it notwithſtanding tourned the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> from his Horſe, with ſo great payne on his right
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13855:112"/>ſhoulder, that he might not riſe himſelfe vp againe, with this fall his buckles brake, and the naylings rent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then halfe vnarmed, he threwe his ſworde from him, putting his knée to the grounde, to giue thankes to his immagined Gods for theyr delyuerye from ſo furious a blowe, and then tourning towarde <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> hée ſayde.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Noble and valyaunt Knight, the ſtrongeſt and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt which I haue euer knowen, or would haue beléeued euer to haue béne in this Courte or others, pardon mée my raſhneſſe, for I haue bene miſaduiſed when my will firſt put mee foorth to contende with you, onely your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bodie and comelineſſe, might haue ſufficed to teach me, that you were more valyaunt and ſtronger than I am, and ſith I am nowe vanquiſhed, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by great myracle eſcaped with lyfe, from your handes, than by mine owne cunning, ſaye on what you commaunde, for I am preaſt to accomplyſh all that, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So the faire Princeſſe as vnacquainted and to begin in ſuch paſſions, not being able at the firſt to counſaile her ſelfe otherwiſe, thought it beſt to diſcouer her griefe to one of her gentlewomen named <hi>Fidelia,</hi> the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt and moſt ſecret of her houſeholde, the which many times had importuned her to knowe the cauſe of her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and one night as ſhe was alone with her, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſayd to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thou knoweſt my <hi>Fidelia</hi> how among all the Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen which I haue, I haue choſen thée onely for the faithfull treaſorer of my ſecrets, &amp; I haue not done nor thought the thing which I haue not imparted with thée, which hath come to paſſe onely by the loiall &amp; good ſeruice,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:114"/>wherein I haue alwayes found thée plyant and diligent, with the lyke confidence vnto that which I alwayes haue repoſed in thée, I will vnfolde vnto thée a ſecrete, which none in the world my ſelfe except, and thy ſelfe ſhall learne at my hande, in the concealing whereof, vnto this daye I haue a thouſand times indured little leſſe then death. And the matter is ſuch, that it is vnfitting for anie one to be a dealer therein but my ſelfe and thy ſelfe, whome I account as my ſelfe. At a worde my <hi>Fidelia,</hi> that tyraunt loue, which ſpareth neither high nor lowe, hath taken poſſeſſion of me by the great proweſſe and beautie of the new Knight, and I am ſure, that but my death, nothing canne ſet me frée: although I haue ſtudyed all poſſible meanes of my lybertie, and thereto haue ſet the defence of my honeſtie and greate eſtate to withſtande this conceit, yet for all that I canne doe, as long as this Knightes race is vnknowen, I cannot eaſe my ſelfe, my former remedies ſeruing me onely againſt the temptation of the fleſh, and not to driue out the rembraunce of his perſonage, whence my deſire ſpringeth. And truely I cannot perſwade my ſelfe other, then that this knightes of-ſpring is ryght no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he being of ſo courtlyke behaviour and knightly, prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe, the truth héereof being ſomewhat more incredible, then the lieng fables of our auncient Poets. Nowe if hée bée a Prince borne, the onely hope to haue him for huſband, my father and be being therewith pleaſed, may yéelde one ſome comfort, in the meane time while opportanitie ſerueth for the finall accompliſhment. Wherefore mine owne <hi>Fidelia</hi> ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue fully laide open the bottome of my heart, that which remaineth on thy part is, to frauile with his Squire or ſome other to wit of what parentage <hi>Roſicleer</hi> is.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fidelia</hi> had liſtned verie attentiuely to that which her Ladie had ſayd, and as ſhe, was verie wiſe, ſo perceiuing by the drift of the ſpeech, that neither her miſtreſſes maladie could be remoued by counſaile, nor that ſhe would accept
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13855:114"/>of it if it were beſtowed, beſides that, that her deſire was lawfull to match with <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> if there were no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in his ſtocke. She could not gaineſaie her miſtreſſe in ftat-tearmes, but made aunſ were, that ſith her grace had layde that charge vppon her, ſhée was confent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, as alſo readie to offer her ſermce in anie other thing for this matter which ſhe now moued, ſhe ſayde, that ſith her graces purpoſe was ſo good, ſhe ſhould not néede to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member her farther in it, for that ſo ſoone as <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſhould returne, ſhe woulde bée in hande with his Squire to boult out the truth of euerie thing, and yet (ſaith ſhee) I cannot beleeue by reaſon of his magnanimitie, but that bée is deſcended from ſome noble progenie, which if it ſo bée, I lyke verie well that your grace is ſo affectioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, otherwiſe I dare not aduiſe you, but yet I will tell you my fancie, it were better for you to abide ſome payne, then to make your head of your vnderling. The beautifull Princeſſe was well apayde at this counſayle, ſo iumping with her former determination, and it greatly aſſwaged the mallice of her paſſion, in that ſhée had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed it to her truſtie ſeruaunt. The next day the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle women entered into the pallaice, driuing a horſe before them loved with the Gyants bodie. At their enterance the hurly burly in the court was ſo great, euery man running to ſée the wonder, that the king with all thoſe which were with him and the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> with her Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ranne to their windowes to ſée what the matter was, and when they ſawe the Gyaunt they knewe him, and as newly abaſhed at <hi>Roſicleers</hi> vertues, they began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend of him as of the beſt knight in the world. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen preſently were brought before the king, which receiued them curteouſly, and they in order declared vnto him and the reſt that which had chanced to <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſince his departure from the citie.</p>
               <p>The king lyked verie well of all, ſaue that when they tolde him that the knightes could not reteurne preſentlye,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:115"/>as minding to purſue aduentures. For the King feared leaſt by béeing ſo much enclined to knightly déedes, theyr good ſucceſſe ſhould carrie them farther off then ſhoulde be for his pleaſure. But the Gentlewoman departed from the king to do their meſſage vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> whom they found in her chamber with the other two Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in her companie. Comming before her they delyuered theyr meſſage with commendation from <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and the two Princes, which had ſent her that Gyant ſo dead, as a ſatiſfaction in ſome parte for the detayning her Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells. The Princeſſe pleaſauntly laughing at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, cauſed the Gentlewoman to goe on in that Storie, and to make reporte of all occurrentes in theyr iourney, which they did ſo faythfully, that the Princeſſe in the tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was not able to coulour her affection towardes <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer.</hi> This tale ended, <hi>Arinda</hi> gaue into her handes the packet, which the Princeſſe opened, and tourning ouer the Iewells found a Letter, which ſhée put in her boſome, taking it to bée <hi>Brianas,</hi> and in lyke ſorte the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Luſitania</hi> made deliuerie of <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Liria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandros</hi> letters vnto their Ladies, with the cofer vnto <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſilua.</hi> The two Princeſſes <hi>Syluerina</hi> and <hi>Rodaſilua</hi> bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great friends, went both together in a cloſet to reade without interruption their louers Letters ſo eloquent and ſo fraught with amorous ſpeaches, which much reioyced the young Ladyes to bée beloued of ſo good knightes, and not to breake off their ſeuerall commendations of theyr knightes and Lords, we wil ſpeake of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who being left alone for the companie of the y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes diſpatched her other gentlewomen into diuers parts of the chamber, to haue a more ſecret ſuruaye of <hi>Brianas</hi> letters.</p>
               <p>When ſhée had read on through that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered with the packet, ſhe tooke that other out of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, which ſhée had founde in ranſacking the pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and opening it ſhée ſawe in Capitall Letters <hi>RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICLEER</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:13855:115"/>ſubſcribed, whereby ſhe knew it to be his, and ſomewhat troubled ſhe folded it vp quickly againe, minding to learne by what meanes that Letter was hid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the iewells. And therefore calling <hi>Arinda</hi> ſhe aſked if that anie one had vnlocked the coffer, after that her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die had deliuered it vnto her. <hi>Arinda</hi> ſuppoſing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe had wanted ſome thing, anſwered. No truly Madame, for I haue alwaies kept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keies, &amp; no bodie euer had them at my hands but <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> which requeſted to ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iewels when we were in the kéepers lodge, and in my preſence he ſhut it, reſtoring me the keies, and not taking out ought wherof I can accuſe him. The Princeſſe ſmelling out <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleers</hi> ſhift, and ſomewhat ſmiling withall, to heare wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto <hi>Arinda</hi> had conſtrued her meaning, replyed merily thus. I aſked it not gentle friend, for that I thought there wanted anie thing in the cofer, for it was wholy loſt when it was in <hi>Brandagedeons</hi> power, but I aſked it for that I meruailed it fell out ſo well, when <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> was the kéeper. <hi>Arinda</hi> waxing bold héereat. Nay marie ſaith ſhée, with your fauour noble Princeſſe, <hi>Brandagedeon</hi> miſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in his minde how little time he ſhould inioy it, tooke little care for the opening.</p>
               <p>So this queſtion who opened it was concluded in a laughter, and little talke continued after. The Princeſſe thinking it long til ſhe might alone read <hi>Roſicleers</hi> letter, and therefore ſomewhat earlier then ſhe was wont, ſhée withdrew her ſelfe into her bed chamber, with onely <hi>Fidelia</hi> in her companie to ſée her in bed. When the doore was faſtned, ſhe drew out <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleers</hi> letter, &amp; not hauing power her ſelfe to read it, ſhe gaue it vnto <hi>Fidelia,</hi> The tenour of the louing letter was this, which héereafter followeth.</p>

                     <p>THat which is appointed by God mightie Princeſſe, may not by mans power bée altered nor peruerted, as in my ſelfe I proue it, for ſince that mine eyes firſt tolde me of your beautie, and my iudgement gaue conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that my will hath procured liking therof in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I haue felt an alteration in me ſo incurable, that ſtriuing with it both by art and nature, I haue not hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to found my remedie: which thing good madame I truſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſéeme more vnlikely to you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it hath ben to me in the feeling terrible. The clap of thunder is the greater when it méeteth with the thicket able to make more reſiſtance, longer laſts the kinled fire in the builded Oke, then in the parched ſtrawe, and more vehement is the fight betwéene two enimies, then when the one yéeldeth. What force loue hath as I could wel wiſh your Ladiſhip to conſider in me, or to feele in your ſelfe, ſo at leaſt I beſéech you to way by others, and to beléeue report, how that with light aſſaults be beateth downe the ſtouteſt courages, and with gentle cords bindeth the biggeſt armes, that his force, neither the wiſeſt nor the mightieſt were able to reſiſt, that from his ſubiection not <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> the greate Monarche of the worlde coulde frée himſelfe: that hée quelled the pride of the mightie <hi>Carthagenian</hi> in the delightes of <hi>Capua:</hi> and fettered <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> two Gods of the Gentiles in chaynes of yron: that he tranſformeth men into ſundrye ſhapes, and as it were by ſodeine inchauntment framed the arme-ſtrong <hi>Hercules</hi> to the diſtaffe and ſpindle: <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> to be bridled and ſaddled: that he climbeth the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Towres, and ſtretcheth to the loweſt valley: that hee diuideth the harde rockes, and bloweth through the eaſie paſſages: to conclude, nothing ſo ſtronge and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, but that loue canne ouerthrowe, and doth what him
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13855:116"/>liſteth. So that if I confeſſed my ſelfe yéelden vnto ſo mightie a conquerour, I ſhoulde yet bée blameleſſe for my cowardiſe. Yet what haue I not attempted? If eyther counſayle of friendes, or mine owne wit, eyther Phiſickes cure, or might of companie-might haue warraunted my quietneſſe. So God, good madame ſpéede my writing as I meant not to trouble you with my Letters. But the weake complaine, and the dieaſed ſéeke remedie, as what griefe is ſo greate or wounde ſo wide, but it hath ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe or other prouided in nature. To you therefore good madame, thus boldly haue I diſcouered my vnreſt, that by your meanes whence onely I may hope for it, I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue comfort. And ſo attending your highneſſe aunſwere either of lyfe or death, I humblye kiſſe your Princely hand.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> penned this letter either not well in his wits, or els greatly perplexed in his thought, ſo hard it is to find an iſſue, but I beléeue rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it came from heart to hand, &amp; was ſo ſet downe without farther aduiſe. Yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time that <hi>Fidelia</hi> read the letter, the faire Princeſſe broad awake to heare thoſe amorous words, &amp; féeling them in her heart with the like loue wherein <hi>Roſicleer</hi> wrote them. When it was ended, heaping out abundance of ſighs vpon the argument of the letter, ſhe ſaid vnto <hi>Fidelia.</hi> Ah <hi>Fidelia,</hi> what force may a tender Gentlewoman as I am haue to reſiſt the tyranny of loue, when ſo many famous &amp; ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Princes could neuer conquere him? How may I ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him which hath had the maſtrie of ſo many, tell me <hi>Fidelia</hi> and counſaile me what I haue to doe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for I miſtruſt my owne wiſedome, and verie fielde is the paſſionates iudgement verie ſure and requiſite. <hi>Fidelia</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13855:117"/>nothing wondering at that effect which loue had wrought in the Princeſſe her Ladie, for ſhe rather wiſhed her ſelfe worthie of ſo glorious paine, anſwered her thus: Madame to counſaile you aright, were to will you to defie loue, and to abandon <hi>Roſicleers</hi> companie, and yet the words of this letter leaueth in me a doubt thereof, if the matter bée as true as the wordes importeth. Next were to deſire you to haue an eye vnto your high eſtate, which yet mée thinketh is not neceſſarie, for I knowe you to be ſo wiſe, as that you will hazarde death rather then commit a thing ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to your honour. Now there remaineth onely to learne out <hi>Roſicleers</hi> lignage, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if he be ſuch a one as may marrie you without diſworſhippe, you may then begin the redreſſe of both your wrongs, otherwiſe if he faile in that point, the firſt counſaile will be moſt conuenient to eſchew his preſence, which ſhall in time doe away this affection, as in time all things are forgotten.</p>
               <p>Heere the Princeſſe interrupting <hi>Fidelias</hi> ſpeach, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner. Ah <hi>Fidelia,</hi> you thinke mée not ſuch a one but that although the loue which I beare to <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> bée ſuch that it procureth me to will his preſence, if he fayle in gentrie, I will rather chaſtiſe his boldneſſe with perpetuall exile out of this land, then giue him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the empayre of my credite, and ſooner will I die an hundreth times, then beſtowe a countenaunce vpon ſuch a one. But this I iudge of <hi>Roſicleer</hi> by the pure and loyall loue which hée meaneth towardes mée, that it is lykely he may merite mée for wife, otherwiſe it is to bée thought that in a knight ſo vertuous there cannot lye hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſuch impudencie as to moue a Ladie vnto her diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure. In ſuch like talke after the Letter read, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and <hi>Fidelia</hi> paſſed moſt parte of the night tyll <hi>Fidelia</hi> tooke her leaue, the Princeſſe notwithſtanding ſtill canuaſing ouer the Letter of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and euerye ſwéete worde which he had written, and ſhe prayed to God with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13855:117"/>all hir heart, that he might proue ſuch a one, as was not vnfitting for a Quéenes marriage.</p>

               </argument>
               <head>Cap. 39.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARinda</hi> remained a long time in the Court tarrieng for ſuch things as the Princes <hi>Oliuia</hi> made readie to ſend vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> vpon which occaſion, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened one daye, the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia, Arinda,</hi> and <hi>Fidelia</hi> to be together, then <hi>Arinda</hi> not ſo well aduiſed as ſhée ought to haue bene, in the ſecret affaires of hir miſtreſſe, vnbridled hir tongue, and declared to the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> all the life and dooings of hir miſtreſſe the Princeſſe <hi>Bria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> as farre as ſhe had any knowledge, and it may be, that ſhe added ſomtime more then truth. Amongſt other things in this tale, ſhe tolde of the little boyes which hadde bene brought vp with the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> reciting the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous tokens which they brought from their birth, and how that the ſorrow of hir Ladie was ſomewhat comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, till fortune brought one of them into a barke néere a great and déepe riuer, running into the maine ſea, as you haue heard before, and that the other of fourtéene yeares (the Princeſſe vnwitting of it) ſtale away. After, entering farther, ſhe tolde that the ſame <hi>Roſicleer</hi> which killed <hi>Brandagedeon,</hi> was the ſame which departed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaue when he was fourtéene yeares olde, whome ſhée knewe at the firſt ſight, and had intreated to returne into <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Princeſſe heard this, driuing to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe demaunded where the Princeſſe had thoſe lyttle boyes. Madame (ſayde <hi>Arinda</hi>) in this ſhall you ſée the workes of GOD howe meruaylous they bée, which from ſo baſe a ſtocke can rayſe ſo worthye Impes, and
<pb facs="tcp:13855:118"/>you ſhall vnderſtand that they be ſonnes to a Knight na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Leonardo,</hi> not of the moſt noble, but of the meaneſt Knighte of the Citie, and for that their Father hath to wife a woman, ſiſter to a Gentlewoman of my Ladyes, named <hi>Clandestria,</hi> for hir long ſeruice in great fauour with hir Grace: for hir ſake, the Princeſſe made the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of theſe children, to nourſe them vp in the Moneſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie at hir charges, vntill they were all loſt, as I made mention. When the Princeſſe had heard <hi>Arinda</hi> in this ſort blazing the of-ſpring of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> what ſorrow maye be compared vnto hirs, for in that inſtaunt ſhe could well haue yéelded to death: and why? For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the onely hope of all hir remedie was in the conceipt of <hi>Roſicleers</hi> high eſtate, thereby meriting to be hir mate, which when ſhe ſawe to be cleane contrarie, ſhe was in ſuch a caſe, as if hyr ſoule had bene taking his leaue of hir bodie. When <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> ſawe hir colour ſo ſoone changed, as vnderſtanding from whence this effect procéeded, ſhe roſe vp, and deſired <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> with the other Gentlewomen to voyde the chamber, for that hir Ladie was newly entered into hir fit, which oftentimes hath taken hir, and ſhe hath no remedie ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as to be alone. <hi>Arinda</hi> and the other Gentlewomen not miſtruſting hir ſpeach conuayed themſelues into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chamber. Now <hi>Fidelia</hi> béeing lefte alone with hir mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, ſhut the doore, but <hi>Oliuia</hi> ſanke downe in a ſound, whom <hi>Fidelia</hi> fetched againe. Afterwards, béeing well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and ſéeing hir ſelfe without other witneſſe, ſhée ſent out a déepe ſigh, with the companie of manie teares, as ſeldome is a ſtormie winde without a ſhower of raine: rufullye withall making hir moane vnto <hi>Fidelia</hi> on this wiſe,</p>
               <p>Ah my <hi>Fidelia</hi> didſt thou not heare what the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of <hi>Hungary</hi> hath ſayd as touching <hi>Roſicleer?</hi> If thou didſt heare it, why doeſt thou not take part with me in my inſupportable griefe? Were it any meruaile at all if my life ſhuld take end with hir report? For ſith the hope
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13855:118"/>which hethertoo hath maintained my reſt, is now ended, I would to God my life would end withall, and rather wold I dye not to heare ſuch newes whereby my hope decayes, then to be priuie to ſuch a trueth, and liue without my comfort. Oh my <hi>Fidelia,</hi> come, come, and helpe me now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſet forward my miſhap with ſome deſperate ſhifte, or to lende me thy faithfull counſaile and aduiſe the better to aſſ wage my griefe, and to forget the ſame miſfortune which now aſſaileth me. Alas, I ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not for my qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe to baniſh <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and if by the excellencie of my eſtate I am forced to chaſtiſe his ouerboldnes, in ſo dooing, I ſhall both barre him from the ſight &amp; light of his eyes, and make the ſtripe redound vppon mine owne head, for who ſhall receiue greater ſmart by his abſence then I ſhal, What a wicked world is this, wherein men of force muſt neglect other mens vertues, and magnifie their own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie without deſert: were it not more reſon to raiſe this man to the top of honour, that in him his poſteritie maye glorie, then for lacke of aunceſtours famous for like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to ſuppreſſe his vertue, and kéepe vnder the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie of his courage? When beganne my Fathers and Grand-fathers to be Nobles, but when with the winges of vertue they ſoared aboue the vulgar ſort, and if by their meanes onely I am aduaunced to be a Princeſſe, what thanke is there to me of my highneſſe? And thou <hi>Roſicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> if by thoſe rare and ſouereigne vertues which flowe and flouriſh in thée, thou doſt mount in credite, not onelye aboue the baſer ſort, from whom thou waſt taken, but alſo aboue Princes and Lords, where-vnto thou arte to make thy aſſent. Art not thou worthie of greater renown then we and others, which climbing by vertue in like ſort, neuer yet came to the poſſibilitie of lyke worthineſſe?</p>
               <p>Is not this a forgerie of the world, and a plaine iuglyng with Nobilitie, when we muſt make more account of one, which perhappes by diſorder of lyfe defaceth the honour of his race, then of one which reacheth vp
<pb facs="tcp:13855:119"/>the ignobilitie of his ſtocke, wherein conſiſteth nobilitie in the opinion of men, or in vertue in déede? and doo men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite vertue, as the childe entereth vpon the fathers land, béeing lawfull heyre? No, héere we receiue naught, but what our ſelues ſowe, and he that reapeth not, may be a loute for all his Lordſhippe, as in time appeareth, which iudgeth fréely and without affection. And for me, if the eyes of my vnderſtanding were not dimmed, I ſhoulde ſoone confeſſe leſſe merite in me to deſerue <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> then wanteth in him to be worthie of me. I am a Princeſſe by my Father, and my glory reſteth in the reckoning vp of a bead-role of Princes, ſome of them dead a thouſande yeare agone, which nothing pertaineth to this preſent age. But he maye be a Prince by his owne vertue, and his Nobilitie ariſeth not by kéeping a Tally of names, but by making iuſt proofe of manhoode in his defence of iuſtice euerie daye, in ſuch ſort likewiſe, that not any of mine Aunceſtoures vertues, whereby they became noble, dare approch to be tryed with his in an euen Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launce. And is there not manie Gentlewomen in the worlde of as high a calling as I am? And is there anye Prince or Knight of ſo high renowne for vertue &amp; knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode as <hi>Roſicleer</hi> is? Haue not the beſt Knightes of both Chriſtendome and Paganſie, ioyned with him either at Tilte or Tourney, and doth he not obſcure them all, as when the Sunne appeareth, no Starres dare come in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? And I ſilly woman hauing not ſo much as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in me of my predeceſſours vertue, am notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the iniurie of the times, bonde to ſo great follie, as that I muſt not thinke him worthie to equall mée, which is much my better. But ſith of force I muſt yéeld to the time, and rather dye then acknowledge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, ſith my Fortune is ſuch that I muſt liue by the immagination of other men, and ſith my eſtate maye not bee yoaked with his baſeneſſe, haue at it, I will for euer ſhut him from my preſence for the ſauegarde of mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:13855:119"/>But withall, ſéeing without his preſence, I cannot find eaſe for this torment, I will make him amends by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer my lyfe, vnto the enduring of euerlaſting ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe. And if it be beſt ſo to doo, tell me my <hi>Fidelia</hi> thy minde, for I perhappes am beguyled by my paſſion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in deede haue I either iudgement or ſéelyng of ought, but of griefe and ſorrowe. <hi>Fidelia</hi> heard the woordes of the Princeſſe, and taking part with the Princeſſe, made vp this wofull lamenting with hir ſorrowfull ſpeach, in this ſort. Alas Madame, howe much better had it bene, that neuer the Knightly déedes of <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had bene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in <hi>Britaine,</hi> for then without the ſight of him, you had neuer receiued this wounde, which nowe feſtering in you for lacke of looking too will be verie harde to be cured. But the wiſeſt ſaye, that in ſuch matters as are hard and difficult, a man muſt eſpeciallye employe his trauayle, and that the ſucceſie is not ſo vnlykelye, but that labour maye reach vnto it, as for this griefe which nowe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempereth you, is not ſo great, but that you maye bee ſoone whole, your ſelfe béeing there-vnto willyng: For in this, neither Nature worketh, neither Fortune, nor the Starres, nor the celeſtiall Signes, nor anye ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Influence, as you ſuppoſe, but onely the fancie and lyking of man: the ſelfe ſame effect with that which in the ſicke is to deſire to be whole and in the thirſtie to drinke. And whoſoeuer with the conſent of his owne will, attempteth the breaking of theſe ſnares, which his fancie layeth to intrappe him in, maye ſcape ſcot-frée, and helpe others in like neceſſitie. Otherwiſe, if this loue wer naturall to all men, as all men then ſhoulde loue by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo ſhoulde they not forbeare it, either for ſhame or friendes diſpleaſure, and if it procéeded from Forture, or by grace inſpired, whereof the cauſe is not knowen, but the euent is euident, then were our lybertie héerein irrecuparable, and in that the principall ſute was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs, it might excuſe the infirmitie of the patient, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb facs="tcp:13855:120"/>as both experience prooueth, that loue hath bene remooued by reaſon, and we dayly chide their impotencie, which are not able to reſiſt the dartes of <hi>Cupide.</hi> It is therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite madame, that your ſelfe put too your hand and frame your will to the obaying of that which may bring reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not onely for the loue which you preſently féele, but for that which you feare will héerafter happen, by your ill brooking of his abſence.</p>
               <p>And truly I am perſwaded, that ſéeing you haue with your ſelfe reſolued to exclude him from your companie, that the beſt is to put it in practiſe faithfully and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leaſt by forbearing of this correction, he take more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to diſturbe your reſt, and yet am I not againſt that which you haue confirmed with good reſon, that we ought to reuerence vertue rather than riches, and in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Gentlewoman which ſhal match with <hi>Roſicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> may thinke hir ſelfe happie, for his rare and maruelous deedes of armes make him to gliſter more gloriouſly then all other Princes and Knights whoſoeuer. And in times paſt, when all things went not ſo ouerthwart as they now doo, he was the beſt of lignage, whoſe proweſſe was beſt knowen, and he beſt eſteemed which wanne his eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his manhood. And to this purpoſe, behold the buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Rome,</hi> by name <hi>Romulus,</hi> taken from his foſter-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſhepheard, and in a manner edified for that erection: although ther were manie buylders in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world both before &amp; after, but the difference of the buyldings, lieth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the workmanſhip. Againe, was there euer one in ſuch credite for honeſtie and wiſedome as <hi>Socrates,</hi> the ſonne of a baſe midwife. <hi>Euripides</hi> one of the rareſt men that euer were in tragicall Poems, was borne of meane parentage. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> the flower of Gréeke eloquence, was a Cutlers ſonne: <hi>Horatius</hi> the Poet, borne of a bond woman, which had bene taken priſoner, and yet all theſe preferred for their vertuous qualities, before Kings and Princes. <hi>Cicero</hi> could not diſſemble his progenie, and yet
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13855:120"/>was he lifted vnto the Conſulſhip in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; neuer proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued other Conſull ſo commodious for the common welth. <hi>Serramus</hi> and <hi>Cnimatus</hi> wiſe men, and throughly exerciſed in their enimies land were Conſulls in <hi>Rome,</hi> and dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered their Countrey from ſpoyle and pillage. And if for a matter pertaining to a Kingdome, we had rather take example of Kings, let vs ſée if meane eſtate hath bene any let for men to aſpire vnto mightie Kingdomes, and by name let vs take a more particular ſurnaye, of the third, fourth, fifth, and ſixt King of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  </gap>pyred to the higheſt place of gouernment in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes. <hi>Alexander</hi> a crowned King was a Gardeiners ſonne: <hi>Pertinax</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> borne of a ſlaue which lyued by thraſhing of graine and fellyng of woode: <hi>Seuerus</hi> the ſeauenth Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> was bredde and brought vp amongſt Surgions, and theſe of the meaneſt ſort. <hi>Agathocles</hi> King of <hi>Sicile,</hi> ſonne to a potter: <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imianus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> chiefe men of the Empire, the one of baſe birth, the other doubtfull, whether a Smith or a Carpenter, and yet neither barrell better Herring. <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> which was called the good Emperour, roſe from lord degrée, and by his vertue blotted out the infamie of his progenie. And to haue more notable teſtimonies, who was father vnto the great <hi>Caeſar Augustus</hi> the ruler of the world? <hi>Virgil</hi> in a ieſt made him a Bakers ſonne, but his owne minde miſgaue him otherwiſe. As for a truth farre
<pb facs="tcp:13855:121"/>worſe be they, which rife to glorie from the miſlyking of their parents, like as <hi>Hercules, Perſeus,</hi> and <hi>Iugurtha</hi> the King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> all begotten in adulterye: and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mightie <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> as concerning whome his Father <hi>Philip</hi> on his death bedde denyed him to be his ſonne by the report of his mother <hi>Olympia,</hi> for which cauſe after his Fathers death, he would needes bée called the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter Ammon. Constantine</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was borne of a young maide before lawfull eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalles: and <hi>Iepthah</hi> in the Scriptures, was ſonne to a harlot. Or if you will Madame, that for lyke examples, we runne ouer the hiſtories where-vnto my wit can not carrie me in ſo ſodaine ſpeach, yet I remember, that fewe yeares ſince there dyed in <hi>Spayne</hi> a ſtout king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Goths,</hi> called <hi>Bamba,</hi> which as I haue hearde, was a labouring man, and at that time when he was to be crowned King, was faine to ſticke his ſpade in the ground, to receiue the ſcepter, beeing neither leſſe feared than his predeceſſoures, and not reſerued by me to the laſt place, as one of leaſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite among others. Remember your ſelfe of the great king <hi>Arthur</hi> your progenitor, of whom (with your graces leaue) I doo not thinke that men of mallyce, doubted whoſe ſonne hée was. And we maye boldly ſpeake of theſe and other things ſo long agone paſſed, without ſuſpect of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyked affection. But why meruaile we at theſe things? Doth not the wiſe man ſaye, that if our lyfe were long, we ſhould ſee many Kings become bond-men, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bond-men crowned Kings, the reaſon béeing the ſame as I haue rebearſed, that in elder age the onely Heraulde to pronounce a man either noble or vnnoble, was his owne good déedes, which aduaunced his good name and renowme aboue the inferiour déedes of Kinges of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>But to paint out the pride of our times let vs caſt down our eyes to the firſt roote, from whence we all toke our beginning, ſhall we not finde it all one for all men? Marry
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13855:121"/>in the bodie of this trée there are many braunches, ſome higher, and ſome onely water boughes, from whome the toppe boughes kéepe off the comfort both of Sunne and ſhowres, yet no man I trow will be ſo enuious as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the growth of the inferiour, if they be more faythfull then the ſuperiour, as not alwayes the talleſt men doe the beſt ſeruice, and the beſt borne for wealth or myght proue not the beſt alwayes for manners and worſhippe. Witneſſe héereto the ſonnes of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> of which two deſcended two peruerſe impes, far more infamous then their parents were famous. And there are infinit mo likewiſe to improue the ſucceſſion of vertue, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſion of inheritaunce. And yet for all this long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I cannot chooſe but reſerue my former purpoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes you, for I am afraide that the moſt parte will not bée of my iudgement. In a worde therefore to make an end in that wherewith be firſt beganne, you muſt conſider both by what meanes and for what cauſes the times are altered, and therevpon take aduiſe according to the time. And ſith that for our ſinnes God hath giuen vs ouer to a wrong iudgement in matters of high eſtate, rather to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre wealth then vertue, and ſith you are nowe fallen vnto that time, wherein this errour generally hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growen the truth, and is ſtrengthened by conſent of men, I would counſayle you to yéelde vnto the time, that is to take it as you finde it, and to make the beſt of your chaunce: for it were great folly for you, and no leſſe daunger to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a multitude, and you knowe your friendes will neuer be brought to eſtéeme ſo highly of vertue in a baſe perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, although a precious ſtone canne neuer be but preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whether ſet in Lead or Copper. You muſt forſake him then, and that is the onely remedie, for according as I haue read and haue hearde the firſt remedie agaynſt a fit of loue, is to exempt our ſelues from the companye of the beloued, and to ſhunne and eſchewe the thinges which may bring it againe to our remembraunce, the nexte
<pb facs="tcp:13855:122"/>is to driue in our thoughtes the things which be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie therevnto: as to thinke with howe many breaches of ſléepe, and with what continuall care wée deſire a thing eyther ſtithie, or vnlawfully coueted, or at the leaſt wiſe tranſitorie, though neuer ſo honeſt, with all to ſet before our eyes what harmes, what robberies, what murthers, what madneſſe it hath cauſed in the world, whereof there be too many hiſtories: but yet from all this you may well signiſe your ſelfe, if you will ſeparate from you your former conceit. And if none of theſe will ſuffice, there is another remedie behinde, which is to beſtow your lyking vpon ſuch a one as may be matchable to your eſtate. For as one naile driueth out another, ſo men ſay that the new loue diſpoſſeſſeth the old, which remedie as I haue read was put in practiſe by <hi>Aſſyrius</hi> the king of <hi>Perſia.</hi> And this is my opinion, which it may bée your grace would not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, were it not ſomewhat troublous, but it you haue an eye to your benefit, thereby I doubt not but that you will well ouercome the trouble, and I praie you ſpéedely take ſome way or other, but the beſt I ſaie ſtill is the former for to alaye the heate. The next is, to take away the wood, and ſo to forget loue, is to remooue from beloued, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that which you quench in a moneth will be kindled in an houre.</p>
               <p>Now the meanes to atchieue your purpoſe, is by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſelfe to <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to this effect, that hée aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your preſence for euer, my ſelfe will bée the carryer: although I haue ſome compaſſion on his paine.

                     <p>BEeing no leſſe iniured by thy preſumption then minding the puniſhment of thy folly, I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto thée. And know thou that thy letter hath come not to me in daye light, nor deliuered in thy name leaſt I might iuſtly haue refuſed it, but in the night time, and that cloſely and by ſtrealth conuayed in my cofer that I might firſt be beguiled, ere I might forethinke mée of the deceit. The receiuing wherof albeit ſo at vnawares, hath ſomewhat blemiſhed my honour, and the ſhame thereof if I thought poſſible to bée rubde out, I would not ſpare for Tems water being ſo néere my fathers pallaice. But to make amendes for my fault, and leaſt thou take ſome pride in thine impudencie, I am driuen nowe to an other inconueniencie, that is to aunſwere thée, whome otherwiſe I woulde not haue vouchſafed in this reſpect, the courteſie of a good looke. In thy letter, the firſt point of thy pride I finde, to bée in bending thy lyking towardes mée. The ſecond and greater, in daring to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it vnto mée. The third and eſpeciall, in forcing mée by coppie of wordes, and an olde tale of loues power to giue ſome reliefe to thy heauineſſe. Which thy intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pride, as it ſéemed rare and ſtraunge vnto me, ſo it made me more narrowly to fiſt, and examining my ſelfe throughly and in euerie pointe, if eyther the lyghtneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13855:125"/>of my lookes or my vnchaſt demeanour, or the lacke of foreſight in my ſpeach, or the familiaritie of acquaintance might giue occaſion to ſo baſe a Knight as to attempt a Princeſſe. Wherein if I coulde haue called to minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie little ouerſight, whereby thou mighteſt haue courage of impeaching my honour, I woulde firſt haue puniſhed it in my ſelfe, as I am now purpoſed to amende it in thée. Onely I remember I beſtowed vppon thée largely: and what then? Thou therefore as <hi>Lucifer</hi> hauing more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then thy fellowe Angells, wilt pull GOD out of his throne. Note that the ſtaye of true vertue is humilitye, and there is no glorie ſo cléere but pride may darken it.

God neuer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the deſire of things allowed by nature, but thou ſhalt finde occaſion of ſmart by thy diſordered affection. What if loue be ſo great as thou paineſt thy ſelfe to proue vnto me? Did not other Princes ſée mée, from whome yet the honeſt regard of my greatneſſe ſhéeleded me, which thought neuer entered into ſo abiect an heart as thine is.

For marke, the greater loue, deſerueth the greater chaſtiſement: and greater is the fault done vppon preſumption, then by ignoraunce or infirmitye,

In which way he ſaw a little ſhip making towards the land, and out of this ſhip, from vnderneath the hatches, there appeared a Gentlewoman verie high and big of body, but of a good complection, and ſtraungely attired as was hir Countrey guyſe. This Gentlewoman as ſoone as the anchors were caſt, cauſed the cocke-boate to be let downe, wherein ſhe entred, and comming to lande, ſhe tooke hir Palfraye to gallop vp the ſandes, but eſpieng a knight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, whome by all ſemblaunce ſhe tooke to be <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> ſhe framed a ſorrowfull countenaunce, and in great ruth ſaluted him, to whom he rendred the lyke ſalutations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding what hir griefe was. The Gentlewoman ſtill counterfaiting a ſhow of great ſorow, as not able to ſpeak any thing, till béeing importuned by him with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doo ſhe as it were forced out theſe ſpeaches.</p>

The Gentlewoman ſéeming to be verie gladde for to haue found him, knéeled downe: but he lyfted hyr vp, and deſired byr to faye on preſentlye what hyr ſorrowe was, for he woulde willinglye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake hir demaunde: the Gentlewoman ſayde on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>Sir knight, not farre hence there is an Iland where my father dwelled, a plentifull land and auncient inheritaunce to our line. This land my father gouerned a great time in peace and eaſe, till that Fortune loath to preſerue things in one eſtate, chaunged hir coppie, and that which grieueth me moſt, found meanes by me, to work the diſcontentment of my friends. For being young and marriagebale, and my Fathers onely childe, it happened that I had many ſuters, but to be ſhort, my Father thinking it ſafeſt for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce of his line, and the peaceable gouernment of his people which hadde rather haue bene ſubiect to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Countrey-man, then an Alien, matched me with a luſtie Knight, both beſt beloued for his worthineſſe and of greateſt poſſeſſions in all that Countrey. Now amongſt my other ſuters, there was one of great liuelood, worthye for his wealth to haue bene preferred before all the reſt, if himſelfe had bene as worthye, but this Lorde was refuſed by me, and taking it as ſome parte of diſgrace, he kineeled his cholar and wrath, againſt my Parentes and me, and at a time conuenient, which was not manye nights paſt, and when we leaſt immagined it, he burſt in vpon my parents, where he found but weake reſiſtaunce,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13855:127"/>but I my ſelfe in the meane while, ſtealing by the ſhore ſide, recouered this little boate, wherein I was ſcarcelye entered, when I ſaw a farre off my Parents and my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande ledde away priſoners. I thinke they cannot iuſtlye geſſe whether I am gone. But after that I was in the boate, I met with manye which came from the inſtes at <hi>London.</hi> They ſéeing my heauie chéere, demaunded the cauſe, and when they vnderſtood it, they directed me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after a newe Knight in the lande, for he alone ſaye they, is able to vndoo this iniurie. You heare ſir, both the cauſe of my care, and the occaſion of comming into this Country to you ſir, now ſir knight, if my ruth may work any compaſſion, or that you thinke I haue cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne, doo your beſt to amend my harme, you ſhall doo double iuſtice in reſtoring the wronged, and in puniſhing the wicked dooer. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> féeling a yerning in his minde, againſt ſo vnlawfull a practiſe, if hir tale were true, badde hir take hir boate againe, for be would hazarde his perſon in hir quarrell. The Gentlewoman deſiring preſently no other thing, gaue him manie thankes, ſo they entered the boate, and the water béeing calme, they paſſed without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daunger. But ſtill <hi>Roſicleer</hi> haunted with his aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thoughtes, nowe ſéeing himſelfe farre diſtaunt from the Princeſſe, and without hope to retourne, beganne a freſh to conſider of his exile, which thought ſo ouercame him, that hee wiſhed his ſoule to departe from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.</p>
               <p>But the Hiſtorie leaueth him on the Sea, to recount in the meane time of his Eſquire, who finding a ſhippe in the Hauen, retourned to his Paſter, but not méeting him, hée was ſore abaſhed, and in great ſorrowe coaſted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Countrey to finde him out.</p>
               <p>After long trauayle by lande to no purpoſe, hée put himſelfe to the Sea in a ſhippe prepared towardes <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> where after continuall wearineſſe, and not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring anye newes of his Maſter, hée tourned towardes
<pb facs="tcp:13855:128"/>his owne Countrey in the Walley of the Mountaynes, where he was well welcommed by his bretheren. There let vs leaue him, till time carrie him from his Fathers home, to méete with his Maſter. Now telleth the Hiſtory, of <hi>Zoylo</hi> Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> which had trauayled towards the Court of King <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> as hath bene recited. When he came to the Court, he found in the Pallaice hall, the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> with the King hir Father, and diuers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Princes, deuiſing and ſporting of diuers matters, and eſpecially of <hi>Roſicleers</hi> worthineſſe, which not a little tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> for all that cruel ſentence which ſhe had giuen of him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tartarian Zoylo</hi> entering the Hall in goodly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the great amaze of the Knights and Nobles which behelde him, after he had made his humble obeyſaunce to the King, he ſpake as followeth. It maye be, noble and worthy King, that the greatneſſe of my eſtate, forbiddeth me to be ſo humble, but the great vertue which I haue found in the Knightes of your Maieſties Court, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced me aboue my wont, to doo you that honour, which I woulde denie els, to anye King or Emperour in the worlde: now I beſéech your Maieſtie to accept of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and to receiue me into the number of your Knightes, for I haue great deſire to belong vnto your Court, if it ſo lyke you.</p>
               <p>The King verye well lyking of the Maieſtie which the Knight bare, albeit he knew him not whence he was, of courteſie embraced him gladlye, and raiſing him from ground, aunſwered thus: Sir Knight, you are very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for as your perſonage and good behauiour is aboue the credite of a meane man: ſo haue I great opinion of your high eſtate: and as to your requeſt to be entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of my Courte, I receyue you willynglye, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you there-in my royall fauour, for I woulde lyue no longer then to make of your lykes, and I praye
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13855:128"/>you ſir Knight tell mée who you are, leaſt peraduenture I ſhoulde fault, in not honouring you according to your callyng.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zoylo</hi> aunſwered, Noſt puiſſaunt King, the report of your courteſie aſſured me your good fauour before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it, and now ſir vnderſtand you, that I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Zoylo,</hi> ſonne to the King of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> in that part which bordereth vpon Chriſtendome, and that I haue ſpent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny winters both an ſea &amp; lande, till that Fortune caſt mée on the Engliſh ſhore, then comming out of Dutchlande. After héere in your Countrey, minding as my vſage was to trye my ſelfe vpon Knights errants, it chaunced that I met with thrée of your Knightes in a Forreſt, their names were as I learned of them, <hi>Roſicleer, Bargandel,</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamandro,</hi> with theſe I iuſted, and after that I had caſt downe the two laſt at the Tilte, I fought with <hi>Roſicle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> at the ſwordes poynt, but in the ende I was vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> when I was yéelden, hauing ſome lyking of me, deſired me to come and be acquainted with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and to kiſſe your royall hand in his name. All which I haue done, as well for to offer my ſeruice to ſo mightie a Prince, as for to accompliſh the charge of ſo valyaunt a Knight, neither thinke I it any diſgrace to be vanquiſhed by him. For beſides that his bountie and courtefie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth to be beloued rather then enuied, his valour and Knighthoode promiſeth the conqueſt ouer the whole world. He hath receiued me for a perpetuall friende, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce doo I more ſet by, then the whole Kingdome of <hi>Tartary,</hi> my lawfull inheritaunce. Therefore becauſe I hope the longer to inioy this new friendſhippe in your fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, I haue bene bolde to craue the name of your Court, which, ſhall be as well welcome vnto me as the title which you haue vnto your kingdome. The king was glad to heare ſome newes of <hi>Roſicleer</hi> at that time, and much prayſed
<pb facs="tcp:13855:129"/>his owne good Fortune to haue lyghted vppon him, for that by him his Court had dayly increaſed in worſhippe, and ſo tourning towards the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> he ſayde on this manner. Pardon me mightie Prince, in that I haue not done you that honour, which appertaineth to a Kinges ſonne, but the little acquaintaunce I haue had with you, and the ignoraunce of your eſtate, ſhall excuſe me, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwardes, if I amende not, let me bée without excuſe. And with theſe ſame wordes, the King ledde <hi>Zoylo</hi> to the Princeſſe, willing hir to welcome the Knight ſtraunger. <hi>Zoylo</hi> comming before the beautifull Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> kneeled downe before hir to kiſſe hir hande, which ſhée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, but gently kiſſing him, ſhe had him welcome. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke had ſhe not, for the often naming of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> brought to hir remembraunce, the wrong which ſhée had done to him, and hir heart was ſo great, that ſhe had no power to ſpeake a word, but crauing pardon, ſhée departed to hir chamber: this ſéemed ſtraunge to hir father, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hir colour was ſo pale, it was thought to be by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>When ſhe was within hir chamber doores, ſhe let hir teares flowe at lybertie, which before ſhe reſtrained for feare of béeing eſpied. And thinking in what maner hir fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court was honoured by <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and in what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation he was holden among thoſe Princes &amp; knights, how glad they were of his friendſhip, and how loth hir fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to looſe him, ſhe burſt out into aboundaunce of teares, and with the repentaunce of hir former fact, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this ſort to repent hir raſhneſſe. Thou haſtie and ouer credulous <hi>Oliuia,</hi> what thing did the poore <hi>Roſicleer</hi> crane of thée, but the acceptation of his ſeruice, and that thou wouldeſt become his Ladie? why diddeſt thou not receiue him offered, eſpecially when ſo manye puiſſaunt Princes and worthy Knights require to haue, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed? why wouldeſt thou not be Ladie ouer him, whom the beſt in the worlde, would be ſervaunt vnto? Where
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13855:129"/>was my iudgement, and the eyes of my vnderſtanding that I forethought me not of theſe things, now doe I too much repent that which I haſtely willed, as touching the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> Héere ſhe ſtayed her ſpeach, and in great diſeaſe of minde, ſhut her ſelfe in her cloſet. Héere nowe wanted the faithfull counſaile of her ſeruaunt <hi>Fidelia,</hi> for had ſhe bene at hand ſhe might haue ſlaked her miſtreſſes ſorrow, which in the end grew ſo farre, as beſides the loſſe of ſpeach and her often ſounding, ſhe fell into a hot burning ague, which left her not of a great while, till more comfort came by meanes of another Letter which ſhée read of her loues to his mother <hi>Briana.</hi> Till that time we will helpe the two knightes <hi>Bargandel</hi> and <hi>Liriamandro</hi> out of the wood, and bring them from the ſearch of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> to the court of king <hi>Oliuerio.</hi>

But I beléeue that he had rather haue receiued his deathes wound, then that letter. Ere he opened it, his coulour chaunged, and all his bodie ſhooke for feare, but after hée had read the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, his eyes were filled with teares, and neuer man was ſo woe begonne as he: yet he read it out, and as I remember, with the laſt wordes he gaue a great groane, and ſanke to the earth.

<pb facs="tcp:13855:132"/>the king and to the other then in preſence, that he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meruailed why <hi>Roſicleer</hi> came not with them, for ſaith he, when I parted from them they were all thrée together, when the king knewe them to be the two Princes, hée cauſed his traine to ſtay till the two Princes came againſt him, thoſe hée embraced with great loue and thankes for their returne, demanding withal for <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> They which I dare not ſay knew the ryght cauſe, but coniectured ſome likely cauſe by the ſtraungeneſſe it wrought in him, with great griefe made a narration of each perticular as farre as they knew, both what befell him within the Realme, and in what manner he auoided the Realme, as they had heard of others onely in the companie of a Gentlewoman, and they added moreouer perhappes of their owne heads, perhappes as I ſayde before, vppon ſome farther know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it could not otherwiſe bée, but that he had ſome great wrong offered vnto him by ſome perſon within the Realme. The King excuſing himſelfe to the Princes for his owne dealing towardes <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> became verye ſad and heauie for him, as alſo thoſe which were néere with him, not béeing able to geſſe of his returne: and indéede if they had béene certeine of his long abſence, it would much more haue béene gréeuous vnto them, ſo rare was the loue they all bare to him. But with ſome little hope of <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleers</hi> ſpéedie retourne, the King with thoſe Princes his friends tarried ſome dayes in the Pallaice, till that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was from them ſo long, the thrée Princes <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandel, Liriamandro,</hi> and the Lartarian <hi>Zoylo</hi> together, tooke vpon them to ſéeke him, in which time they aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured many ſtrange exploits as ſhall be ſpecified héereafter in this Hiſtorie. But in the ende as the greateſt parte of theſe nobles and Princes ſtayed in <hi>England</hi> for the loue of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> ſo his preſence wanting in that court dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſo faſt, that in ſhort time there was not behinde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Court anie Knight of great account, but the Prince <hi>Don Syluerio,</hi> vnto whom the loſſe &amp; abſence
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13855:132"/>of <hi>Roſicleer</hi> bread no ſmall contentation, as it wrought in the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> to the contrarie no leſſer diſpleaſure and diſquiet, as if the loſſe of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> had agayne renued. For there was no one in his kingdome which could and would aduaunce his priuate credit and the honour of his Countrie by worthy proweſſe and by valiant déeds of armes.</p>
               <p>But when all the kingdome beganne to bewayle the loſſe of <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> what did that fayre <hi>Oliuia</hi> which had abandoned him the Countrie, and loued him more then anye one in the worlde, might ſhée forget him one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? No, but when ſhe wayed well that for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of her charge he had forſaken the lande, her good will increaſed towardes him, and in ſtéede of the daylye viewe of his perſonage, in his abſence ſhée gazed at will vppon the counterfayte and portraiture which ſhe had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in her fancie. This did ſhe the oftener becauſe ſhée founde not in her ſolitarie contemplation anie other thing to preſent it ſelfe. For amorous thoughtes are euer enimies to companie, and béeing alone, as commonly ſhée was by reaſon of ſickneſſe, what was there to remooue this ſolitarie thought and conuerſaunt companion from her.</p>
               <p>This companion ſhe ſtill enterteined, which by vſe and continuance of time grew to a ſetteled ſentence, and her loue waxed greater then it was before, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the flame which burnt more earneſtly then euer before it had bene. But as it chaunced, toſſing of theſe things in her remembraunce, withall ſhée remembred that <hi>Arinda</hi> had tolde her how that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> and as the amorous are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to builde themſelues Caſtles of Hope, albeit ſometime without foundation or ſure grounde whereon they may ſurely ſtand: ſo her loue waxed ielous ouer him, and ſhee beganne to caſt with her ſelfe why <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſhould write to the Princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> being to her no kiffe
<pb facs="tcp:13855:133"/>nor kinne to her, and ſo meane borne, out of which in the ende ſhe picked out this hope, that out of doubt his birth was as good as his bringing vp. In this matter therefore ſhe laboured <hi>Fidelia,</hi> ſecretly to ſteale that Letter from the Gentlewoman <hi>Arinda</hi> her bedfellowe, and talking about this matter one certayne time with <hi>Fidelia,</hi> among other thinges, ſhée ſayde. Oh my <hi>Fidelia,</hi> as I had the power to baniſh <hi>Roſicleer</hi> the lande, ſo woulde I that I coulde baniſh him from my memory, how profitable had thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile bene then vnto mée, but what ſhall I doe for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie is no more auayleable, ſince his abſence woundes me more then his preſence, I graunt thée the fight of the beloued to ſome increaſeth loue, ſtill offering it ſelfe to be ſeene, and yet to other ſome againe the thing dayly ſéene bringeth little delight but rather lothſomeneſſe as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe ſometimes loue is mooued by diſcontinuance, and ſometimes mens deſire increaſeth the flame, albeit the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued appeare not in preſence. But this thou takeſt to bée impoſſible, for thou art not touched with the like paſſions, and none knowes the bitterneſſe thereof but the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, as appeareth by thée which haſt miniſtred a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine not of force againſt my diſeaſe. But make me amends and once againe venture for my ſake, I remember that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> hath a Letter of <hi>Roſicleers</hi> to the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> to what purpoſe I knowe not, but I would gladly ſée it, this ſteale from her and bring it mée that I maye read it, I cannot ſay what good newes my minde foretells me by it, but ſure I long to reade it, as if there were ſome great ſecrete conteyned therein, and quiet ſhall I not be till I haue had it. Héereto <hi>Fidelia</hi> replied briefly that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhoulde bée lefte vnto her to watch her epportunitie, and indéede when <hi>Fidelia</hi> and <hi>Arinda</hi> ſlept together one night, <hi>Fidelia</hi> eſpieng <hi>Arinda</hi> faſt on ſléepe roſe as ſoftlye as ſhée might, and taking one of the keyes which <hi>Arinda</hi> had tyed to her girdle, therewith ſhée opened the cal ket and pulled out <hi>Roſicleers</hi> Letter, which ſhe brought to her
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13855:133"/>miſtreſſe lodging, whom ſhe found waiting for ſome gladde newes. The Princeſſe her ſelfe would not open the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but gaue it to <hi>Fidelia,</hi> which vnſealed it and read as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Fidelia</hi> had ended the letter, and the Princeſſe had well vnderſtood the ſecretes thereof, what tongue may expreſſe the great ioye that entered into hir ſorrowfull minde, as if ſhée had but nowe recouered hir loſt hope, and hadde ſhe not nowe counterpaized hir auncient ſorrowe with this late ſprong ioye, hir life had bene in daunger, for in no other thing exceſſiue ioy may doo ſo much harme as in the heartes of true louers.

Where were mine eyes and iudgment, when I did not prooue his nobilitie by his vertue, howe great was my pride, in that I woulde in ſuch ſorte deſpiſe ſo worthye a Knight, and banniſh him, not onelye my preſence, but this Kingdome alſo?</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:13855:134"/>
               <p>O inconſtant and fraile woman-kinde, for iuſt cauſe lyghtly regarded among wiſe men, ſith we are lyght in beléefe, lyght in iudgement, and ouer-haſtye in ſhewing the effect of our conceite. What occaſion had <hi>Roſicleer</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me, that I ſhoulde make exchaunge for the great good will which I bare vnto him, with ſo cruell a ſentence, as to diſpatch him from my preſence? What had he in his letter, any diſhoneſt word, any vnlawfull demaunde, or did he mooue me to the thing preiudiciall to my great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. This he deſired, that I ſhoulde knowe he loued me: why ſhoulde I be aſhamed that my inferiours loue me, and that he ſhoulde lyke of me, was the thing I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Tell me <hi>Fidelia,</hi> what is thy counſaile for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende this faulte, me thinkes we are in worſe caſe then before. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> is alreadie departed the Countrey, and if I ſende to call him backe, he will not regarde mée, or will it not be thought lyghtneſſe, after that I had in ſuch earneſtneſſe refuſed him, as it were yeſterday, this day ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainelye to alter my purpoſe? Beſides that, when hée retourneth into this Court, his glorye maye encreaſe to my diſ worſhippe, and againe, if to beare out my former facte, I let the matter paſſe as it hath done, what ſhall then become of mée? I knowe not howe to lyue, hée being banniſhed from my preſence, whome I loue better than my ſelfe. But <hi>Fidelia,</hi> as thy parte was in the firſt counſayle to banniſh <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> ſo nowe put too thy helpe that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> maye retourne againe, without the blemmiſh of mine honour.

               <p>Madame leaue off your complayntes, and be more gladde then euer you were, ſith God hath bene ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto you as to make <hi>Roſicleer</hi> of ſo high eſtate that
<pb facs="tcp:13855:135"/>he may merite you. For in good ſooth I ſtoode in doubt whether of your paynes were the greater, and I knew no meanes howe to ſlake them. But fith now this ſecrete is diſcloſed, the remedie is in our handes, and not ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as you make it. For bée it that you ſhall ſend vnto <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> to demaunde pardon of him for the offence which you haue committed againſt him, ſhall you thinke you doe your ſelfe anie wrong therein in reſpect of your princely eſtate. No, for aſſuredly he loueth you loyally, and becauſe he is of nigh parentage with you, you may therein beguile ſuſpitious eyes, and after his retourne you maye boult it out of him, whether he loue you, yea, or no, if hée doe, without peraduenture you maye acquite him, and loue of all thinges woulde bée rewarded. I dare war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt that your loue ſhall detayne him with vs, and to this purpoſe madame your hande and my head which ioyntly committed the former fact, ſhall nowe together make the recantation, and crye <hi>Pecaui.</hi> The effect maye bee onely to will him to reſourne to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and my ſelfe will bée the meſſenger, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe neuer to refourne into this Countrey till ſuch time as I finde him, and haue deliuered your Letter to his handes. Withall ſayth ſhée, this ought prſently to bée put in practiſe, for by the griefe <hi>Roſicleer</hi> tooke at the ſight of your Letter, I geſſe that hée is eyther departed this lyfe or auoided the Countrie. The Princeſſe was verye well content with her haſt, as the thing which ſhe moſt deſired, and ſo embraced ſhe <hi>Fidelia</hi> gladly, and ſpake vnto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fidelia</hi> nowe I knowe the good will which thou haſt to ſerue mée, and I confeſſe that I haue not made thee priuie to my heauineſſe without greate hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at thy handes, therefore I beſéech GOD once to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde thée as I wiſh, but bring mée penne, Inke, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for I will ſtraight way followe thy counſayle héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Fidelia</hi> brought vnto her penne, inke, and paper, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

               <p>This letter, the ſequele will ſhewe vnto you, when we come to the meeting of <hi>Fidelia</hi> and <hi>Roſicleer:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, the letter written after this manner, was delyuered vnto <hi>Fidelia,</hi> and it was agréed vppon betwéene themſelues, that vppon the nexte daye ſhée ſhoulde goe to ſéeke him. This night they tooke theyr reſt, the one, for the better enduring of hir long trauaile, which ſhe ſhoulde ſuſtayne, the other, to make ſatiſfaction for hir broken ſléepes. Ere broade morning <hi>Fidelia</hi> was vp, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conuayed <hi>Roſicleers</hi> letter where ſhe founde it, ſhée went vnto the Princeſſe, to take hir leaue of hir. When as they were departing: Oh my good <hi>Fidelia,</hi> ſayde the Princeſſe, doo as much as thou mayſt to retourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne ſpéedely, for if thou ſtayeſt long, I ſhall lyue but a ſmall while, there is nothing that may ſo ſoone ſhorten and cutte off my dayes as to hope without ſucceſſe, and to dreade the worſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fidelia</hi> was verye ſorie to thinke of the cares, which hyr Ladye, was lyke to receiue, and principally for that ſhée ſhoulde teaue hir alone wanting with whome to communicate hir payne.

The Gentlewoman houering about the banke, nowe ſure of his eſcape, and ſtraining hir voyce, cried. Come foorth, come foorth, ſonnes of <hi>Candramarte,</hi> for héere is the newe Knight, which cut off our Fathers armes. Now wiſt <hi>Roſicleer</hi> by this horne, and the Gentlewomans out-cries, that he had bene betrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as one careleſſe of life, as quietly as he could, hée prepared himſelfe, which he certainely looked for, his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was this. Lorde Ieſus haue mercie vppon me, whome thou ſo dearely haſt bought with thy bloud-ſhed, pardon my ſinnes, and receiue me vnto thy Kingdome, as for my carcaſe, be it as thou haſt appoynted me, for death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not betide me in a better time.</p>
               <p>After this, he ſtayed, not as diſmayed, but paſſing farther to ſée in what manner this treaſon was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, he ſawe the gates of the one Caſtle ſet wide open, and thence iſſuing a huge Gyant vpon a mightie Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, with more then twentye Knightes well armed at his tayle. At theyr firſt comming, they made a great ſhowt, as if they had got ſome great victorie, &amp; the Giaunt amongeſt the reſt ſayd vnto him. Thou miſerable and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13855:137"/>wretched knight wel ſhalt thou abie the ſhame which thou diddeſt to my father <hi>Candramarte,</hi> when thou diddeſt cut off his armes at <hi>London. Roſicleer</hi> as deſperate made aunſwere: I doubt not but for all your threates you will giue me leaue to dye, but ere that happen, it may bée you ſhall bée diſappointed of your purpoſe, and with that hée drewe out Quéene <hi>Iulias</hi> Swoord, with the which hée en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered the tall Gyant which came againſt him with a great Speare. The Speare hit <hi>Roſicleer</hi> on the breaſt, and indéede were it not for the fineneſſe of the armour, it had pearced him, but the mettall being ſuch as it was, the <hi>Greeke</hi> made no more for the blowe then if it had béene hit with ſome delicate young knight, and before that the Gyaunt coulde recouer his horſe raine to fetch the ſecond courſe, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> gaue him ſuch a blowe with his Swoord that hée cleft him to the bowells, the great gyant fell dead to the ground, the bloud iſſuing in great abundance. Héere the great bragge was quailed, when he which came to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge anothers mans quarrell could not warrant his own ſafetie.</p>
               <p>But truth it is, that thoſe which vnmeaſurably doe ſéeke reuenge, doe oftentimes heape on themſelues the greater miſchiefe. And what did this tyrannous <hi>Candra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marte</hi> elſe, which placing himſelfe at his windowe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the battayle, and to make more ſolace at <hi>Roſicleers</hi> harme, as if the onely report had not béene ſufficient, now in ſtéede of his former wrong he found a greater by the death of his ſonnes, but yet this is the beginning onely of his miſerie, for the valyaunt Knight not fearing death at all, in greate choler ruſhed among the other Knightes which lykewiſe aſſayled him couragiouſly, and had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while with their battaile axes hewen his horſe in pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>When hée was on foote he layde about him manfullye that in ſhort ſpace the ſcantling of grounde in which they fought was couered with breaſt-plates and Targets, and
<pb facs="tcp:13855:138"/>as their number leſſened, and that he had more roome, ſo his courage increaſed and he did them more ſcath: but well fare his inchaunted armour, which had ſerued to more purpoſe in defending then his ſwoorde in offending, or elſe his courage had tyred before the ende of ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a fraie. Now there are fewe aliue, and thoſe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtriuing for lyfe vpon the graſſe, or in weake caſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon foote, readyer to flye then to fight: but preſently there came freſh ſuccours from the other Caſtle. For the other ſonne of <hi>Candramarte</hi> with more then thirtie knightes in great haſt came againſt this good knight, not béeing idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupyed among the other Knightes. The Gyaunt for other good morrowe gaue the good knight ſo ſtrong a blow with his battayle Axe vppon the head péece, that had it not bene rather in the head péece to withſtand the blowe, then in himſelfe to reſiſt the Gyaunt, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had layne braineleſſe on the grounde, but all this gréened him not, ſauing that the weyght of the blowe made him kiſſe the earth, whence yet he ſtart vp lightly, and minding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite courteſie for courteſie, as hée was purpoſed at the Gyant, there ſtept in a knight betwéene them, whome <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> diuided to the breaſt bone, whereat the Gyaunt and thoſe which behelde him were much abaſhed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, they béeing many and hée wearied, hée might not defend himſelfe long from them, eſpecially from the Gyant, which onely watched opportunitie of aduauntages, yet lengthened he the fight by his noble courage a long time, vntill for verie faintneſſe he was faine to giue backe and get his ſhoulders agaynſt a wall, from which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde hée was driuen by maine force, and béeing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, he withdrewe himſelfe to the Sea, euer as hée war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one blowe beſtowing another. After he had got the Sea at his backe he waxed bolder, and aboue all watched <hi>Candramartes</hi> ſon which had hurt him, moſt eſpecially him he hit ſo ſure, that the bloud guſhed out in thrée or foure places.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:13855:138"/>
               <p>In the meane while <hi>Candramarte</hi> viewing the battaile to no great liking blaſphemed heauen and earth, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the windowe ranne to the Sea ſide, where the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle was continued, and with a lowde voyce he called on his knightes, reuiling them as cowardes and daſtardes if one Knight might reſiſt them ſo long, and aboue all to his ſonne he ſpake thus. Thou vile and daſtarde ſhéepe, how lyke thou art to thy miſerable mother, I ſweare by heauen and earth if thou eſcapeſt out of this battayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, my cauſe and thy brothers death vnreuenged, that I will ſtarue thée in the ſame place where I ſtarued thy mother.</p>
               <p>The Gyaunt and his knights thus railed on, for ſhame and feare gaue a freſh aſſault vppon the good Knight, ſo that as he diſpatched ſome, there ſtepped in new in theyr roomes: and euer the battaile was as it were newe to beginne to poore <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> which draue him to ſéeke far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuccour in the water, and to ſtande vp to the nauell, thinking his death to bée verie night, he prayed to GOD with all his heart for his ſoules health, as one that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deteſted his lyfe, and determined no longer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende himſelfe then the water would giue him leaue. Then taketh he his ſwoorde with both his handes and lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on ſo thicke, that there are ſlaine more then tenne knights ere he leaueth, as the Sea gaue witneſſe which made the banke ſéeme as all bedewed with bloud. Nowe beholde and ſée howe GOD neuer forſaketh his, and eſpecially thoſe which abide his pleaſure: as he did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Knight, and now ſtanding equally betwixt lyfe and death, though neither fearing the one nor hoping the other, and ſure of neither, yet hath he remedye beſides his hope and is comforted of his owne brother, vnknowen to both.</p>
               <p>So may Fortune ſometimes vexe and anoye vs: yet at the length ſhe retourneth backe and relenteth agayne. But for this matter which wée intreate off, we are to
<pb facs="tcp:13855:139"/>remember our ſelues of that valyaunt <hi>Grecian</hi> ſonne to the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> lefte in the little Boate ſayling through the Occean Seas, with the which he had paſſed the bounds of <hi>Africa,</hi> and coaſting by the <hi>Mediterraneum</hi> Seas, was driuen along the Spaniſh ſhoare, and from thence at length ſayled by the Ilande of <hi>Candramarte</hi> at ſuch time as <hi>Roſicleer</hi> nowe inforced himſelfe to abide the vttermoſt of the ſkirmiſh, with reſolute mind preſently to receiue the death or to bée conquerour. But this boate guided by a wiſe man as you heard before, tooke landing almoſt againſt <hi>Donzel del Feboes</hi> will, about a bird bolt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſhot from <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> where he eſpyed a cruell fight, but that which moſt amazed him was, that one knight (though ſtrong timbered and valiaunt) yet had ſet himſelfe agaynſt ſo manye, and with theyr bodyes had made ſo greate a ſlaughter. So with a great admiration, rather amorous then iealous, he ſayd vnto himſelfe. Who woulde beléeue that in our dayes there might bée founde a Knight furniſhed with ſuch excellencie of manhoode. Aſſuredly his fame is as worthie to bée ſpoken off, as that Greekes which had killed the famous <hi>Troyan Hector.</hi> Thankes bée to the Gods which haue brought mée hether, for although I ſhoulde looſe my lyfe, I will not leaue him vnſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Thus ſayeng he waded in the water to come néere him, and ſéeing the Gyaunt to oppreſſe him ſo much and without a ſhéelde, for hée had loſt it in battayle with the firſt Gyaunt he tooke his ſwoord with both his hands, and let driue with all his force at the Gyauntes head that he cleaued it vnto the braine, and afterwarde ruſhed among the reſt, killing many of them. When <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſawe with one blowe the Gyant ſtroken downe and ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoped for ſuccours, the greate wonder that hée receyued may not bée tolde. And as if the enterpriſe had bene at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued or his lyfe ſaued, with a freſh courage hée went out of the water, and valyauntly thruſt himſelfe among
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13855:139"/>his enimies, where he well gaue them to vnderſtand that hée was deſirous the battayle ſhoulde ende. Héere two bretheren albeit vnknowne each to others, gaue brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye helpe in time of néede. And there was neuer a one lefte, which eyther cryed not pardon, or fledde his waye, the ſupplyauntes were pardoned. But let vs thinke of <hi>Candramarte</hi> which now ſawe his other and onely ſonne ſlaine at one blowe, in what plight doe you iudge him to hée, but the worſt is good inough, whereas if ſhe had held in his hungrie deſire of reuenge with a long delaie, or had diſſimuled his choller hée might haue liued quietlye with his ſonnes by him, able ſufficiently to defend forreine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion, and mainteine his. But now childleſſe, knightleſſe, and armeleſſe, beſides at the mercie of his enimie, he was farre out of charitie with all the world, that curſing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, and what was in them, he runne headlong into the ſea, there drowning himſelfe among the waues, &amp; bequeathing his ſoule to the diuell, who long ere that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be his executor.</p>
               <p>Tell mée I praie you gentle readers, howe often you haue ſéene the vnmeaſurable deſire of reuenge haue a luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie ende, or not rather to procure a father harme, when as that which might bée pardoned or diſſimuled with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, afterwarde is bewayled with ſorrowe and griefe. It is written that he that ſéeketh reuenge, vengeance will light on him. For why the ſame God ſayth. To me ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce belongeth, and I will reward it. O ye malitious and wicked men which with infinit trauaile beate your heads to ordeine miſchiefe for the leaſt diſpleaſure. Take this leſſon for your amendement, and make <hi>Candramarte</hi> your example.</p>
               <p>But let vs continue our hiſtorie of the two brethren, the Knight of the Sunne and <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> which nowe the battaile béeing ended and the miſ dooers pardoned, had lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leyſure to learne of each other who hée was. <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> pulled off his viſour and ſpake to the Knight of the
<pb facs="tcp:13855:140"/>Sunne, ſaieng. Knight the moſt valiaunt that euer I met withall, I knowe not how to reward you for the greate friendſhippe you haue ſhewed to me, but tell me your name I oraie you, and I ſhall account my ſelfe the happieſt man this daie liuing, and while I liue will I remember your valour. The knight of the Sunne noting the great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of knights with the mangling of armour in that place where the firſt battayle had béene fought, beſides the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous blowe wherewith the firſt Gyaunt had béene ſtaine, and after viewing his perſonage, his bearde but now burgening, he pulled off his helmet, and after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of his beautifull lookes, ſuch as paſſed all the knightes of his time, he aunſwered gently. Right valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt Knight, I am to thanke my Gods for that they haue brought me hether in ſo good a time as to knowe ſo valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a knight, and to ſee with mine eyes the knighthoode which I would ſcarce haue credited with mine eies: but whereas you demaund of me whom I am, know you that I am called the Knight of the Sunne, for the deuiſe which I beare in my armour, and for my birth I can ſhew you no-farther, neither know I more of my eſtate: but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture which brought mée hether hath béene by occaſion of a ſtorme which draue me on this ſhoare, and this is the firſt lande whereon I ſet foote ſince this tempeſt tooke my ſhippe, and courteſie commaunded mée to lend mine aide when I ſawe you ouermatched with number. And thus much for aunſwere to your demaund: but now agayne that I haue tolde you that which you required, ſo I praie you tell me your name, and for what cauſe this cruell bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile hath béene fought betwéene theſe Gyaunts and you. While the Knight of the Sunne ſpake thus, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him verie ſadly, and hearing him ſay that he was the Knight of the Sunne, and that he knew no more of his eſtate, hée thought that peraduenture this ſame might bée his brother of whome <hi>Artemidoro</hi> had tolde him ſuch meruailes, but leauing this ſuſpition till he might queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13855:140"/>of it more at large, he ſatiſfied the knight of the Sunne as to his queſtion in ſhort ſpeach after this manner.</p>
               <p>Your friendſhippe was great, and ſo I make reckoning of it, otherwiſe I ſhould not haue happened on ſo good a time to tell you my name, in which becauſe you would learne of mée, you ſhall vnderſtand that my name is <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer,</hi> and that I was of good report in the Court of king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> the king of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> although my miſhappe cauſing it, I doubt me ſo much that my name is once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned amongeſt them, but that matter I will leaue off as not pertinent, this which you require about our fight ſprong vpon this occaſion, and ſo he ſhewed the whole order both of the receiuing of his <hi>Auant Cheualier</hi> at the kings hands: the firſt dayes iuſting: the ſeconds dayes combat with <hi>Candramarte:</hi> the honour of the iuſts: the enuie of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dramarte:</hi> &amp; point by point the whole ſtorie as you heard before.</p>
               <p>Which tale <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had ſearcely finiſhed, when the Gentlewoman which all this while remained in the ſhip cryed out, whereat they turning their heads, ſawe in what manner ſhée outraged, ſaieng. O ſpightfull Fortune doe what thou canſt, for the ſuccour which I haue wanted on lande, I hope to finde in the bottome of the Seas, and the God <hi>Neptune</hi> which hath power ouer the ſwelling waues, ſhall kéepe me from farther vengeaunce, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe leaped into the Sea, but being clad in large gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſhée could not drowne preſently. The knight of the Sunne and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſéeing her in that eſtate, pittyed her greatly, but ſhe was too farre off for them to wade néere, ſo the knight of the Sunne tooke his boat haſtely to helpe the Gentlwoman, where otherwiſe then he looked for, the boate was carried by violence another way, and albeit hée ſtroue to bring it towardes her, yet preuailed he nothing, for it ſayled in the Sea as ſwiftlye as ſometimes the cloudes racke in the aire béeing driuen by the windes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with greate griefe loſt the ſight of the
<pb facs="tcp:13855:141"/>boate, werefore fetching a déepe ſigh, as for that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hope was cleane daſhed to haue found his brother, he ſaid as followeth.</p>
               <p>Fortune the thing which I moſt deteſt, therein thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe moſt fauourable vnto me. This is my life which now twice thou haſt reſtored me without my wiſh, but that which my heart moſt deſired, and with which my lyfe ſhould finde moſt eaſe, therein thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe an aduerſarie to me, ſo that whatſoeuer good happeneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, thou makeſt me thinke that it happeneth for the worſt, for the longer I liue, the more are my paines increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now by that time that he had lamented a while for this ſodeine loſſe of the ſtraunge knight, he ſawe the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman caſt vppon the ſandes not yet dead, whome he cauſed thoſe Knightes which were eſcaped in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle to carrye vnto the Caſtle, and there to finde ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for her. Thus the knights did, with whom he went to one of the Caſtles, where for this time we will leaue him, to follow the knight of the Sunne on his iourney by Sea.</p>

               <p>WIth great ſwiftneſſe and incredible haſt the Boate whereas the Knight ſayled was carryed, paſſing in ſhort time the déepe <hi>Atlantike</hi> and Weſt Occean, néere the vttermoſt Cape of the Ponent, till from thence it droue vppon the Pillours of <hi>Hercules,</hi> where his mightie arme and ſtéeled forke made place for the Occean to enter, and water the earth. This Sea is called <hi>Mediterraneum</hi> Sea, and into this Sea the Knight of the Sunne ſhooued his Boat, where he found well peopled Townes and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delight then appeared in the winde and Weſt Occean,

               <p>Well on all griefes, whether for his fréendes <hi>Brandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel</hi> and <hi>Claueryndo,</hi> or this vnacquaynted <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> or the vnſkilfulneſſe of his waye were extinguiſhed, by that his learned Gouernour guyded theyr Barke whether it was conuenient. So ſtill hoping for the Porte and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, wherein his little boate ſhoulde ride, he ſayled as I ſayde in the middle earth Sea, where, on the lefte hande, he ſawe <hi>Spaine, Portugall,</hi> and thoſe Countreyes, where he coulde gladly haue beſtowed himſelfe, but that he was not to commaund the ſtéereſ-man: but in good time came he thether, as ſhall be recited in the Hiſtorie heereafter. Although by ſhoare on the right hande he lefte <hi>Affricke, Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Tures,</hi> and forwarde as he ſayled, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Ilandes <hi>Baleares</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> with the warlyke <hi>Italy,</hi> and the fertill <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the flames of <hi>Aetna</hi> hill a while ſtayed him. There might hée ſée the ruinous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyques of olde <hi>Syracuſia,</hi> and many perilious Mermaydes haunting thoſe ſhoares, much feared by all the Marriners. Then ſawe he the freſh water of the riuer <hi>Nylus,</hi> which entereth the Sea by ſeauen mouthes. From thence on the other hande might hée ſée <hi>Greece:</hi> where-with hée woulde more willynglye haue fed his eyes, if he had then knowen the right which he hadde theretoo. But from thence he lawnched into the broade <hi>Euxino,</hi> where the wide Sea conuayed all thinges out of ſight, that nought appeared, but clowdes aboue, and waues beneath. Long thus he ſayled, meruayling when his Nauigation ſhoulde take ende.</p>
               <p>After this, as it were a faire calme following a ſtormy
<pb facs="tcp:13855:142"/>tempeſt there appeared aboue the water a faire Iland vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which his boote draue, whereat he was merry and pleaſaunt, thinking that there abode him ſome aduenture, wherein he might trye his manly proweſſe, and full fayne he was to leaue the Sea: héere I ſaye at this Ilande, his Barke ſtayed, whereby he knewe that his iourney was thetherward.</p>
               <p>Then the Knight leaped to lande, vppon the enterie whereof, there was a banke caſt of harde ſtone, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farther, he ſawe a freſh and pleaſaunt ſoyle, full of the-ſwéeteſt hearbes that euer he had ſéene. There was a fence or cloſure made of tall high Trées, ſome of them with ſo loftye toppes, that it wearyed him for to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. Beneath this, there was a Meddowe platte whereon grewe manye flowers and hearbes of all ſortes, and it was compaſſed with a ſtill water, gently rolling vppon the Pummiſe ſtones, the water was as cleare as any Chriſtall.</p>
               <p>Among the thicke trées, he might haue ſéene the ſwift Harte, and the faire Vnicorne, with the little Beueret, and the ſmall Conney banking the gréene boughes, beſide the lyght Squirrell clymbing the tall Oake, with the ſéete chirping layes which the Birdes made, recording ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauntly among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tender ſprayes, that it would haue made a man vtterly forelorne to receiue comfort, and hée that was ſurpriſed with loue or loues daries might haue found a more preſent remedye, then the Hartes of <hi>Creete</hi> doo, when they are wounded by the Hunter. This pleaſure to haue enioyed, you would haue thought your ſelfe to haue bene tranſported into another worlde or into a celeſtiall Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>When the Knight of the Sunne had both behelde and hearde all thoſe thinges, hée immagined preſentlye that the Iland was well ſtored with people, thether reſorting for the deſyght there to be founde, but yet he meruayled why their pathes were no more trodden, and gazing on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13855:142"/>euery part which waye to take beſt, hée tooke the waye which was moſt beaten, therein he walked heaufly laden with his armour: but his deſire to knowe the end of this aduenture, and the ſwéete melodie of the birdes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye accompanieng him, made him thincke his iourney ſhorten.</p>
               <p>About a mile or more out of this medow, he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a plaine paſture ſo beſet with flowers as the meddowes were. In the middle of this paſture, as it were a bow ſhot from him he ſawe the farreſt Caſtle which euer eye hadde ſéene, as well for the height and largneſſe, as for coſt and workmanſhip.</p>
               <p>The matter was all of Jaſper, which when the Sunne began to caſt his beames thereon, ſhyned ſo bright, that it dazeled the eyes of the beholder. The forme was qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle after an euen proportion, as broad as long. In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the corners, there were ten faire Turrets, which reached by mans ſeeming to the clowdes. The outwarde wall of the Caſtle was harde Marble hewed but of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande <hi>Paros.</hi> Round about the Caſtle there was a déepe ditche, with a deuice, that albeit there was no Spring in it to nouriſh it, yet was it mayntayned with a freſh flowe, partlye by the fall of waters from the mountaines, partlye by the Riuers we named amongſt the meddowes, which at euery ſpring cleared the channell. Vppon this water there ſtoode a Bridge with thrée ſtrong Turrets, one in the beginning, the other in the middeſt, the other in the ende towardes the Caſtell. Through them a man cannot enter but by plaine force, for the kéepers open not but conſtrayned, and they néede to be right valyaunt, for the Porters are fell.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne gazed vppon this verge at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuelye, ſo amazed at the ſtraungeneſſe of the worke, that he coulde not thinke it to haue bene buylded by mans hande. And hauing as then no other ſkill of God, but the Gentiles lawe, he thought that peraduenture this
<pb facs="tcp:13855:143"/>might be the houſe of his Gods, when they deſcended from heauen to ſoiourne amongſt vs. So verye deſirous to know the ende thereof, he came vnto the bridge, where he ſtayed a while ere he procéeded farther, for hée indged that according to the greate ſtrength of the arches, the depth of the water, and the height of the wall, that no man might enter without leaue aſked. And as be there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not matter of meruayle for the wonder of the caſtle, ſo meruailed he that nére ſo rare and magnificent buyld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo meruailed he that nére ſo rare and magnificent buyld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he met no perſon of whome he might demaunde to whome the fayre Caſtle did belong. Amid theſe thoughts it ſéemed beſt in his fancie to call to them within, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes any would aunſ were him, and therefore comming to the gates of the firſt Turret which was then néereſt to him, he founde a Porch opened, and right before a faire ſtately Court, encloſed with walles of Jaſper, and in the midſt before him a payer of ſtaiers of a ten or twelue degrées which ledde vp to a fayre Piller, wherevnto was faſtened with a chaine of golde, a faire horne and a rich brawdricke to it. The horne was tipped all with golde, and in the ende were ſet manye precious ſtones. The riches thereof, might haue contented a right couetous eye. Vnderneath the horne, vppon the ſame piller, there were ingrauen letters, which the Knight of the Sunne perceiuing and hoping there to learne ſome more newes he mounted vp the ſtayres, and read as héereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                           <p>When he had read the letters, and gathered by them that there were Porters to aunſ were him, hée feared not a whit for all the threates of the Writing, but with an heroycall heart he vntied his horne, and winded it ſo ſhrill, that all the Caſtle eccowed with the noyſe. At the ſounde héereof, the inner gates of ſtéele flewe open, as if they had bene ſhaken with a tempeſt, and preſently there appeared a fierce Gyaunt, bearing in the one hande a barre of yron, and in the other a chayne, wherein hee ledde ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Dragon, the moſt hydeous that euer man looked on.</p>
                           <p>This beaſt was from the breaſt downewarde, as high as auye man on horſe-backe, and the tayle thereof was tenne paces in length, wherewith he ſwéeped the grounde. Nowe the ſtrong Gyaunt comming out of the gates, let looſe the Dragon, and tooke the barre of yron in his handes, paceing towardes the Knight, which was nowe in deſcending from the Piller. Ere the Knight coulde eaſely come to the grounde, the Gyaunt mette him with a counterbuffe on the ſhielde, that he miſſed two or thrée ſteppes in comming downe. The monſtrous Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon beneath, was readie to receyue him. But the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe of <hi>Alicante</hi> lyghtly eſtéeming all this, and rather tooke courage in this, that there was ſome thing worthye his paines behinde, when the Caſtell was kept by ſuche vglye Porters, and drawing out his ſworde, hée ſtroke at the Serpent a blowe on the toppe of the head, but it did him no more harme, then if it hadde lyghted vppon a Smithes anfielde, but it a little benummed his ſenſes, and beguyled him of his fore-hoped grype. This litle harme which he had done to the Serpent, did much amaze him, and the better to ſaue him-ſelfe from the Serpent, hée gotte vnder the Piller, and then hée beſtowed another blowe vppon the Serpents head with all his force.</p>
                           <p>The Serpent ſo ſore ſtriken, wared woode, and brayed out ſo lowde, that all the Courte rang of the noyſe, and fayne woulde it haue gotte betweene the Knight
<pb facs="tcp:13855:144"/>of the Sunne, and the place vnder the Piller where hée ſtood to haue raught him in his pawes, but the good knight defended himſelfe lyghtly from him, and layd at the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon ſtill with the ſword. The Gyaunt abode ſtill at the ſtaters foote, to wait for the Knights tumbling on the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: at length he came downe headlong, where the ſtrong Gyant let driue at him ſo great a blowe with his Barre, that the barre burſt, and the good Knight thought his head had bene bruſed: with this, as well as he might, hée roſe vp, and driuing at the Gyaunt, he cut his legs cleane from his body. The Gyant falling to ground, the Serpent ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his tayle, graſped at the Knight of the Sunne, but I cannot tell how the Knight eſcaped it, and withall be tooke vp the greateſt péece of the barte of yron which the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant had, and haſting towarde the Serpent, he gaue him ſuch a blow therewith vpon the head that he fell downe, and before he could riſe, the Knight gaue him ſuch another, that his ſcull as harde as flint burſt into two péeces, yet for all this, the great Serpent was not throughlye dead, but bounded vp into the ayre, and ſwept the ground with his tayle, ſéeming more fierce then at the beginning. The Knight of the Sunne purpoſed to ſtrike no more, but quickly gate vp higher on the ſtaiers to be out of daunger, in the ende, the Dragon ſtirred no more, whereby he iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was dead, and meruailyng what beſides there might be found in the Caſtle, he hung the faire horne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, and with the barre in his handes, he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the firſt Lower, and from thence through the firſt arch of the Bridge, till he came to the ſecond Tower, which was in the midſt of the Bridge, the gates whereof were of ſtéele, and ſhut as faſt as the gates of the firſt arche were. <hi>Cheualiero del Febo</hi> winded his horne, and preſently the gates were opened, and there came iſſuing out a Gyant no leſſe ſtrong then the firſt, hauing in the one hande a club, and in the other a chaine, wherein he ledde a Lyon, the mightieſt of lymme and biggeſt of boane, that euer man

                           <p>This Lyon the Gyaunt vntyed ſtraight, and ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Knight, which with no little courage, as hée hadde a greater Nueſt in hande awayted him, and at the firſt blowe hée ſtrake him ſo fell vppon the heade, that the braynes ſtarte out, and the monſterous Lyon fell ſtarke deade, without more ſturring. When he had this done, he encountered the Gyaunt, and the Gyaunt let driue at him: But the Knight not minded at that time to aſſaye or put his truſt to the fine mettall of his enchaunted Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, ſtarte aſide, that the clubbe fell vppon the Bridge: but before the Gyaunt coulde reare his clubbe, the ſonne of <hi>Trebatio</hi> hit him ſo ſtronglye beneath the knées, that his ſhinne boanes were burſt withall, and the Gyannt with great clamours fell downe, the Knight of the Sunne leauing him ſure inough for making reſiſtaunce, tooke vp his heauie-slubbe to goe farther, and to ſee what was within.</p>

               <p>Thus paſſed hée through the ſeconde Tower, till hée came to the third and faſt Tower of the Bridge, whereof finding the gates ſhut as the other, he winded his horne, and with the ſheilneſſe thereof, the gates burſt open, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as great a noyſe, as if the bridge had re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it in two, preſently ſtepped foorth a huge Gyant, nine foote in height, all his bodye couered with a tough hyde, ſo harde and ſtrong, that no ſworde coulde enter. At his waſte hée hadde a ſword, and in his hande a chayne of yron, whereto were faſtened two Tygers of wonderfull greatneſſe, by the fierceneſſe of theyr lookes, able for to haue affrayed anye man.</p>
               <p>For all this hardie <hi>Grecian</hi> was nothing appalled, for he lyfte vp the heauye clubbe ſo ſtrong, as if the great <hi>Hercules</hi> ſhoulde haue come to fight with him, onelye with the ſhow, it might haue made him to tremble.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13855:145"/>
               <p>Thoſe fierce beaſtes, ſo ſoone as the Gyaunt had vnlooſed them, opening theyr horrible mouthes, ranne with ſuche ſwiftneſſe vppon him, that if ſéemed theyr féete touched not the grounde. At ſuch time as they came both vppon him, he gaue one of them ſuch a blowe vpon the ſhoulder, that he burſt all his boanes in péeces, wherewith the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger fell to the grounde. Then came the other, and caught holde of him in the ſhoulder, ſo griping him, that he coulde not ſtirre his arme neither one way nor other, and graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt all the head-péece within his ſharpe téeth, hée thought to haue cruſhed it in péeces, but the helmet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the head, and the Magicke armour kepte off the tearing of his nayles. Nowe the good Knight ſéeing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe of his clubbe, nor vſe of his ſworde, while he was thus entertained by the Tyger, throwing awaye his clubbe, he ſtrugled and wraſtled ſo long with the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that in the ende, he caſt the beaſt vppon the hard flynte ſtones, with ſuch a fall, that the braines flewe out of the head. The wylde Gyaunt, when he ſaw the Tyger thus ſlaine, with an helliſh furie he went towarde the Knight of the Sunne, and taking his long ſword, he gaue him ſuch a blowe vpon the toppe of the helmet, that there ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled out great flakes of fire, and the Knight fell vpon his handes and knées. But as ſoone as he coulde, the Knight recouering his ſworde, requitted him ſo couragiouſlye, the Gyant beeing vnarmed, that had not the ſtrong hyde ſtood him in ſtéede of complete armour, the ſworde had entred the fleſh, whereof at that time it miſſed. Héereat the wilde Gyant taking vp againe the heauie ſword, ſtroke the Knight of the Sunne vppon the toppe of the head-péece, but he auoyded the blowe lyghtlye. In ſuch ſort, that the heauie ſword fell vppon the grounds, and brake in péeces the hiltes onely remaining in his handes. Nowe before the Gyant coulde raiſe vp his ſword, the knight of the Sun ranne him through. When the Knight of the Sunne hadde accomplyſhed thus much of his purpoſe, hée thought
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13855:145"/>there had bene no more to be done ſaue now to know the ſecretes which abode behinds, and wherefore this ſtraight warding was ordeined. Therefore he went through all the bridge vntill he came to a path way which lead betwéene the outward wall and the great caſtle. When he had wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked this path, about a bowe ſhot off he ſawe a little doore, all engrauen with ſundrie kinde of portraiture, the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof with the varietie of the Storie therein por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, might haue held a good caruer a long time: the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magerie was ſo drawen that it woulde haue troubled the wit of <hi>Praxites</hi> to haue matched it. The gates were not great, but the chiefe part was of ſtéele as ſurely cloſed as the firſt.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne thinking that percaſe they would open at the firſt puſh, ruſhed againſt them with all his force, but his labour was loſt, and hée preuayled no more then if hée woulde haue broken downe the walles with his féete. Therefore he winded his horne, whereat the gates burſt open, but no man appeared without, ſaue that when he was about to enter he ſawe two Gyauntes the one on the one ſide &amp; the other armed from top to toe, with head péeces of fine ſtéele, and theyr armour a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thicke in déepneſſe, they held in their handes two bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle axes raiſed vp aloft readie to diſcharge their blowes vpon the commer in. The fierceneſſe of their ſemblaunce was ſo ſtraunge that it is harde to beléeue that anye man had the courage to enter againſt his will, but if it had béene the dogge <hi>Cerberus</hi> he could not haue defended him the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>This valiaunt knight ſéeing them in ſuch ſort prepared for the fight, albeit hee wanted not courage to aſſaye that fearefull entrie, yet he ſtayed in doubt how he might enter without daunger, and warde the two firſt blowes. For to receiue both theyr blowes at once was not poſſible without great hazarde, and otherwiſe enter he coulde not, but after long pauſing he came néerer, and as if hée would
<pb facs="tcp:13855:146"/>haue paſſed through hée ſhewed himſelfe, whereat the Gyants as if he had entered indéed let driue their blows, the whileſt the knight ſtept in betwéene them, and taking the next to hande he hit the one Gyaunt ouerthwart the pawnch, but his ſwoorde entered not. The Gyantes which at their firſt blowes had broken their heauie clubbes drew out their broade arming Swoordes, and layd at the knight of the Sunne. The one he receiued on the ſwoord, the other he auoyded lightly by ſtepping aſide. And willing to ſée the ende of the aduenture he ſtroke one of them full vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſour, wherewith he had thought to haue hewed his face, but he was deceyued, for it did the Gyaunt no more harme then if he had béene ſmitten with an haſill wand.</p>
               <p>The Gyants now laide on loade, but he diſappoynted them by the deliuerneſſe of his bodie. And now conſider what thought this good Knight was in to féele himſelfe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed by two fierce enimies, and not able to hurt againe. Neither was it poſſible to maſter one of them by wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for both the weaker of them two was too ſtrong for him, and perhappes while hée ſhoulde deale with the one, the other might diſpleaſe him. So that neyther of theſe wayes were conuenient, without ſome preſent helpe the daunger certeyne, yet in the ende he beganne to rebuke himſelfe, euer ſayeng: Sticke to it thou coward, and albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it as yet it ſéemes impoſſible for to eſcape this perillous ſkirmiſh, yet ſtirre not thy foote, either ſhalt thou ſoone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome or ſoone looſe the victorie, but neuer ſhalt thou looſe thy infamie, if thou die flyeng, many times ſuch harde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures haue bene occaſion of greater glorie, and if anie bodie but my ſelfe atchieue it, I ſhall not lyke my ſelfe as long as I liue.</p>
               <p>So gazing about to ſéeke aduauntages he marked the wicket ſtanding open ſomewhat beneath the Porche, where through hée might well paſſe by lyttle bowing himſelfe, but neyther of the Gyauntes, might except they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13855:146"/>fell on all foure, for they were higher then he by the breſt downewarde, when he ſawe this doore he bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe how to be out from the danger of blowes which fell into his braine at a time of néede. Thus it was as the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntes were deſirous to hit him, he euer ſtooped vnder, &amp; watching one of them, as he was lyfting vp his armes, before the blowe coulde deſcend, he ranne and cloſed with him, and taking him by the girdle carryed him by ſtrong hand, and with all his force ranne againſt the wicket, that the Gyant not béeing able to paſſe through burſt both head and ſhoulders againſt the wall, the gyant there dyed in his armour.</p>
               <p>This done the ſtrong Knight paſſed farther, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bodie fall, with as much ſpeede as he myght hée ranne to méete with the other Gyaunt, which then appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with his ſwoorde in both his handes to haue ſmitten him. But theſe Gyaunts little acquainted with feates of armes, and the knight of the Sunne by the dexterity of his bodie defended himſelfe lightly from them and obteyned victorie.</p>
               <p>For when the Gyaunt had let his ſwoorde fall out of his handes, he embraced the Gyaunt with both his hands, and tourning himſelfe twice about, at the thirde time hée let him fall, that through the waight of his bodie his gall burſt in his bodie, and he dyed preſently. This mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous combat béeing ended, the good Knight was nowe wearie, and therefore tooke his eaſe vppon a ſeate of ſtone which was in the Porch, there to occupie himſelfe, hée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the ſtrong buldinges of the Caſtle. After roaming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to finde ſome other waie to depart thence, he found at one ende another gate all of yron, and the gates ſhut as all the firſt, whereby he ſawe that he had yet farther tryall to abide.</p>
               <p>And therefore he reſted himſelfe where he ſate, after which done he aroſe, and paſſing through the firſt wall to the ſeconde he founde the Gates ſhut, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:13855:147"/>he winded his horne, preſently the ſtéele gates opened, and there came out thereof a flame of fire accompanied with great ſmoake, as if it had bene ſome place of hell, vntill the ſmoake vaniſhed away he could ſée nothing. After he ſawe before the gate a beaſt in forme like a Crocodile, but ſome what more hidious, as it were a miſhapen monſter, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by nature to ſhew the lothſomeneſſe of deformitie. Out of his mouth he ſent great flakes of fire, in the fangs there ſate a tuſke without the mouth about halfe a yarde verie ſharpe and cutting.</p>
               <p>The good knight abaſhed now to ſée ſo many fierce kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in that Caſtle, as if it had bene nothing but a lodge of warders, (as he ſuppoſed) to kepe in durance the ſonnes of <hi>Titan</hi> which once rebelled againſt <hi>Iupiter.</hi> The which tale he had often heard in the Gentiles lawe, and yet the trauaile of conquering grieued him not alyke to the long looking for of the end, but not minding to debate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at this time, he tooke his ſwoord in his hande, aſſailing the entrie, but the vglye beaſt caſt out ſuch a flaſh of fire that the Knight of the Sunne little lyked of it. And not being able to indure it, he gaue backe till the heate ſhould ſlake.</p>
               <p>This may a man ſaie, that it troubled the Knight more then all that had paſſed, one cauſe was for the extremitie of heate, another for that he ſawe no waie to come néere the beaſt, for before he might approch it, the beaſt woulde be all on a lyght fire, but remembring himſelfe of the club which he had left in the firſt entrie, and thinking that it ſhould be the beſt weapon he might haue, be ranne to fetch it, and retourning ſpeedely he founde the monſter as you heard before ſpitting out his fire. The Knight of the Sun with his long reach in his hand gaue the beaſt vppon the forehead ſuch a blowe that the head rent in two, and the terrible beaſt fell to grounde, beating his feete agaynſt the grounde ſo hard, that it ſeemed the Caſtle ſhooke with all, and the ſmoake which it ſent forth, as at the quenching
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13855:147"/>of a great fire, ſo blinded the Knight of the Sunne till it was ſtarke dead that hée might not enter: from thence after hée came to a faire Court, the ſumptuous building whereof amazed him much, that in compariſon the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtatues which <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> erected, might not more delyght him: no, nor yet the wonders of the world, the ſtately Pyramides of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wherein one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their kings are buryed, and wherein they waſted the moſt part of theyr ſubſtaunce might lyke delight them. In beholding the ſtraungeneſſe of theſe buildinges, I cannot tell preciſely his thought for euerie circumſtaunce, but if his thought were as my thought, or if the report bée true which firſt came from him, ſurely there was matter inough to gaze vpon, but what thinke you he noted eſpecially? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a marble ſtone, but as it fell out to ſome good purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In the Marble ſtone were engrauen the valiaunt actes of all knights aliue or dead, in ſuch order of time as they liued. Firſt the auncienter, then the later, till hée came to the néereſt, verie fewe or none omitted. A rare péece of worke, and muſt néedes haue bene done by other cunning then ſtorie or caruing, for the one the paynes were inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, for the other no mans reading ſtretcheth ſo farre as to knowe euerie Storie. But héerein hée tooke great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and from the laſt to the firſt he ranne them ouer, hée ſtayed at his owne picture, wherevnto ioyned nexte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue was <hi>Trebatio,</hi> and the next beneath was <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> Theſe thrée pictures were freſher in his fancie then the others, as if they had béene newe made. Remembring by the picture of <hi>Roſicleer</hi> the countenaunce of that Knight whome bée had founde in the Ilande of <hi>Candramarte,</hi> hée yéelding forth a great ſigh, and bleſſing the picture from the bottome of his heart, he ſpake theſe wordes vnto lyke purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Thou art a right good Knight, and worthely placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the moſt famons Knightes of the worlde, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
<pb facs="tcp:13855:148"/>not that among ſo many as are héere painted there is one ſo valiant as thou art. For albeit commonly we make much of our elders vertues, it is but as commonly many things ſhew fairer a farre of, whereas when they come to tryall, they are but as ordinarie.</p>
               <p>After this he muſed in himſelfe who that <hi>Trebatio</hi> might bée, for he neuer hearde of ſuch a man: but by the draught of the picture, hée tooke him to be a comelye perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, of a milde and ſadde countenaunce, and it did him good to beholde him: ſo looking farther he ſawe the whole Storie of the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> drawen vnderneath, from his firſt landing in <hi>Hungarie</hi> till the houre of his enchauntment in that Caſtle. Howe he was in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye of <hi>Lindaraza</hi> without knowledge of himſelfe, or witting to his friendes. Now did he at length learne the purpoſe of the ſtrong wardes, which was to holde in the Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> there bewitched for the companie of <hi>Lyndaraza,</hi> whome before he could reſhore to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelfe, hée muſt bring from that péere of the Caſtle which was inchaunted to that onely effect. This when hée vnderſtoode, it pittyed him much that ſo good an Emperour ſhoulde there bée in holde by falſe meanes, to the great ſorrow of his ſubiects, and principally of his wife the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> whom ve ſawe likewiſe all cladde in blacke lyke a widdowe, and to worke ſome meanes of his deliuerie, he looked about him which way was beſt to take, and liking beſt one of the gallories the which was néereſt to the paued court, that he followed, mounting vp a payre of ſtaires all made of Iaſper, in the midſt whereof he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming downe a bigge knight, armed with rich and gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering armour, his face bare and of a freſh coulour, which approching to him drew out his ſwoord, and without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng ought, laide at the knight of the Sunne as fiercely as he could.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne woulde rather haue talked with him to haue learned ſome newes, but it coulde not

There began a hot ſkirmiſh, that the claftering of their armour and the flaſhing of theyr Swoordes rang throughout the Pallaice. This furie notwithſtanding la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted not long, for the Knight of the Sunne in a cholarike rage hit his aduerſarie ſo ſure vppon the toppe of his helmet, that the bigge Knight fell downe and laye for dead.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne ſtayed not to make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of him, but rather hauing compaſſion on him (for hée ſéemed a noble-knight) he vnlaced the knightes helmet to giue him ayre, but not being able then to recouer him, hée paſſed farther, and comming to the gallorie, hée then went vp another payre of ſtayres ſo wide and broad, that if two were going vp néere the two endes, ſcarcelye the one might knowe the other. Nowe in this his waye albeit many things were which might haue ſtayed eyther an idle gaſer or a curious eye, and many thinges beſides to haue inuited a wearied man to take his reſt, yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of finding the Emperour carryed his féete, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming the paines of the waye he came to a portall curiouſlye wrought, to the entrie whereof there lead thrée ſteppes of beaten ſiluer.

In the arbour néere the entrie he ſawe a number of faire Gentlewomen clothed with ſilke, their breaſts bare and white as Snow, ſome played on inſtrumentes, and other ſang ſwéetly to them.</p>

Alas my Lord, I ſhall dye vnleſſe you doo iuſtice on this Knight, which hath héere entered without my leaue, and which hath interrupted our ioyes by the deſtroieng of my kéepers.

Noble Emperour I confeſſe I demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no leaue, and till now I met with none which woulde aſke wherefore I came, but my arrant is for your ſelfe, which heere liue vnknowen, and haue forgotten your wife and Empire. The Emperour angerly replyed: neither thou nor the whole world may bring me hence, &amp; for thy good zeale to put me from my ioye, ſtay a while and I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite thée thy fée. So haſtely he flang to a chamber where he armed himſelfe, the while that <hi>Lindaraza</hi> whom it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as in eſpeciall, reuiled the Knight of the Sunne for his thether comming. O ſaith ſhe, thou ſaucie and vnman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Knight, how haſt thou had the face to enter my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in deſpite of my Porters, either depart hence quicklye or tarrie to abide the Emperours puiſſaunce.</p>
               <p>And if my minde deceiue me not, I ſhall ſoone be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for this diſgrace. The Knight of the Sunne knowing how grieuous it would be vnto hir, that the Emperour ſhould leaue hir, layd contrariwiſe with faire wordes to perſwade hir to giue conſent to his departure, ſaieng Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Lady, may you not content your ſelfe with ſo manye yeares, in which you haue detained this noble and famous Emperour both from wife and kinred, from land and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, but will you alſo for your pleaſure, neither laſting nor honeſt, vndoo a whole Countrey, and take a man from his wife, which hath mourned for him twentie yeares.

The Knight of the Sunne knowing, that what the Emperour did, was but as done in a dreame, would not ſtrike him to doo him harme, but onely to ſaue himſelfe, and to finde the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring <hi>Trebatio</hi> from that inchauntment. Therevpon by little and little he gaue backe, that the Emperour fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, he might in the ende bring him from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted chamber. This came to paſſe accodingly, for as he made ſhew of lacke of reſiſtance, ſo the Emperour thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to followe the aduauntage, purſued him to the great chamber, where the inchantment firſt tooke effect. In ſhort, by this fore-ſaide meanes, there alſo this Emperour was brought to the poynt of auoyding the chamber, whereat <hi>Lindaraza</hi> fearing leaſt he might be led, cried with a loud voyce. Stay, ſtay, my Lord, for this Knight is full of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and if you go out of this chamber, both you and I ſhal die. Héereat the Emperour, who was not deſirous of anye thing but to pleaſe hir, returned backe. The Knight of the Sunne would not follow him, but ſtill kept at the pitch of the entrie, and the Emperour would not come to him for feare of <hi>Lindaraza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wel, this deuiſe not ſuccéeding the Knight of the Sun, thought now to trie if he might carrie him by main force. This he knew would be a daungerous matter for the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which he knewe in the Emperour, but all was well imployed, if he might ſet him at libertie. So towardes the Emperour he goeth, whom not prepared to fight, he ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catcheth in his armes, and with a luſtie courage raiſeth him from ground to haue carried him away, but before the Knight might get to the doore, the Emperour catching hold likewiſe, held the knight ſo ſhort, that for a while they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in therhall, neither part gaining any great ſcantlyng
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13855:150"/>of ground, but the ods was the Knights, and in the end he quickly lifting vp the Emperor wold he or not, he brought him without the chamber. The Emperour ſtrugled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the doore, but in their ſtrugling, they both tumbled downe the ſtaiers. Now hath the Knight of the Sun plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the man, for ere they came fully to the ground, the doores of the inchaunted chamber clapt together, wherewith, and with the noyſe thereof, a great parte of the edifices ſanke withall.

For he neither knew countrey nor parents. But as the remembraunce of his wife and Empire cauſed in the Emperour much griefe, ſo he beſought the Knight of the Sunne that they might depart from thence to goe into <hi>Greece,</hi> where he might better thank him then he had earſt done. The Knight of the Sunne with a good affection to beare him companie, condeſcended eaſily, rather yet vppon deſire to knowe the Countrey, wherein he had heard to be right valiaunt Knights, then of any hope of rewarde. So when they came neere the outward Court, they found that Knight (whome the Knight of the Sunne had lefte in a traunce) nowe retourned to himſelfe and vpon his féete ſafe and ſound. The Knight when he ſaw the Emperour and the Knight of the Sun comming downe, giuing great ſighes and wéeping bitterly, began to ſay. Oh what a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall daye is this for me, nowe my ſiſter <hi>Lindaraza</hi> is dead and I haue loſt a ſwéete companion, I would rather that I had bene killed by this ſtraunger, which hath deſtroyed all our good, then that I ſhould lyue and ſuſtaine ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Little haue the monſtrous kéepers preuailed, whom we put in our Caſtle to defende hir lyfe, and to defend the death which ſo ſodainly hath taken hir away. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hearing him, and knowing him, ran to imbrace him, ſaieng.</p>
               <p>My deare friend <hi>Flamides,</hi> how chanceth this heauines in your countenaunce? Why doo you fetche ſuch déepe ſighes, and ſpill ſo manye teares with ſo great ſobbes. If it be for my departure, and for the lybertie which I haue
<pb facs="tcp:13855:152"/>receiued by this Knight, you know how long time I haue heere remained out of my remembraunce, and forgetfull of my Empire and kingdome, and ſhall I not goe to comfort hir, which long time by my abſence hath bene comfortles. My Lord ſayd <hi>Flamides,</hi> I can not denie but your reaſon is good, and that the iniurye hath bene great in detayning you ſo long from thence, but as your excellencie knoweth, there is no loue more naturall then betwéene brother and ſiſter. O the death of my ſiſter <hi>Lindaraza</hi> pearceth mée to the heart, and I had rather then my lyfe, haue accompanied hir in death, then thus to bewaile hir lacke after death. For ſo ſoone as you came out of the inchaunted roome, my ſiſter dyed preſently, ſo was it appointed by the deſtenies, that no longer then ſhe ſhould enioye your preſence, ſhée ſhould liue. Bleſſed man, ſaid the Emperour, and is <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daraza</hi> dead? yea aſſuredly quoth he. Nowe on my honour (ſaid the Emperour) hir death grieueth me, and during my lyfe ſhall I be ſadde, as ofte as I ſhall call hir to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, and although my caſe is ſuch, as in more néede of comfort, then likely to comfort others, yet me thinkes, I maye tell you, that you ought not to bewaile hir death ſo much, for belike a long time haue you knowen that hir life ſhould not laſt after my departure. Nowe, wherefore doo you lament hir ſo ſore, as if it were but now thought on, &amp; not before foreſéene. Againe, your ouer-much carefulneſſe in fortifieng your Caſtle, was but néedeleſſe, for it is giuen to man to haue the maſtrie ouer beaſts which either by Arte or Nature become tractable. And be it your Caſtle hadde bene inexpugnable for all men in the world, yet what fence had you to ſhut out death. A man in no place can warrant himſelfe ſuch ſafetie, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at euery ſtep he draweth himſelf néerer vnto death. Whether we be frée or bond, on foot or horſebacke, ſléeping or waking, whole or ſicke, we daylye draw néere vnto our ende: or if you wil ſpeake more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to our perfection, for then man beginneth to liue indéede, when he goeth out of this miſerable world.</p>

Now for that along the ſhoare there were no more boats, the Emperour was ſomewhat ſorrowfull, ſéeming to him that he was ill furniſhed to goe whether he purpoſed, and telling it to the knight of the Sunne. The knight of the Sunne aunſwered.

               <p>Thus it is, that after they were all embarked in the Hauen which was néereſt to <hi>London,</hi> they ſailed forwards a monthes ſayling, not deſiring to bend either this waye or that way.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13855:158"/>that the. <hi>15.</hi> daie after they were departed from <hi>Perſia,</hi> they landed in a hauen of <hi>Polonia,</hi> where their ſhippe ſtood ſtill, and taking land to learne ſome newes and know the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, ere they had long trauailed they ſawe before them a little towne, to their iudgement pleaſant, and round about great flockes of men and women ſcattered, and making great cries as if ſome great miſchaunce had happened to them. <hi>Armineo</hi> demaunded of them the cauſe of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, wherevnto an auncient man amongeſt them aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a fierce Giant with more then fiftie knights had come in this morning vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſteale awaie the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Clarinea,</hi> daughter to the king of <hi>Polonia,</hi> theyr liege Lord, that he had killed the greater number and ſpoiled the reſidue. And as he thought was ere this time on his waie with the Princeſſe in his carriage, from whome if it ſo be, not all the world may recouer her: why ſo ſayde <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo,</hi> and where is the king, or where are his knights that they doe not defend their Ladie. The olde man aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they are in a towne foure mile off, not mindfull of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuch matter, and it hath not bene paſt eight dayes ſince the Princeſſe came to this towne, and now this which you haue heard hath happened to her: when the thrée knights heard this of the olde mans relation, without ſtaieng lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they gallopped with their horſes ſo faſt as they might, &amp; comming néere to the towne, they ſawe iſſuing out of the gates a great troupe of knights, the one parte driuing the other before it. For ſo it was that the Gyaunt hauing the Princeſſe in his power was carrieng her awaye, and the townſmen fought with him, but their power little preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Gyant was ſtrong, his knightes many, and ſo they murthered all that came, in ſuch ſort that all the Towne dwellers flod: then came the other knightes, which ſlewe many of them. Twentie of the Gyants knights at once fell upon them laieng at them with all theyr forces, the meane while that the Gyaunt helde in his armes the Princeſſe <hi>Clarinea,</hi> and thinking that his knightes would make
<pb facs="tcp:13855:159"/>riddaunce of theſe thrée, he tooke no more kéepe but rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſoftly with the Princeſſe. The Princeſſe cried out ſo loud, that it was great pitie to heare hir, and thoſe which heard hir of hir owne knights, came pitifully crieng to the knights ſtraungers, that for the honour of God they ſhuld goe helpe hir. When this was ſpoken <hi>Brandizel</hi> beſought his companions to ſtay there in the battaile, &amp; to giue him leaue to follow the Giant, which when they granted him, he putting the ſpurres to his horſe followed the trace, the whiles the knights of <hi>Fraunce</hi> throughly galled their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For the one of them matchable I dare auouch with the auncient <hi>Franconio</hi> the <hi>Troyans</hi> ſonne of whome hée deſcended: for he putting himſelfe in preaſe among them, to ſome he claue their heads, to other ſome their ſheeldes, murdering many and felling manye, that at length there was none ſo hardie, which durſt ſtand him a blow, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of them did his beſt to ſaue one. His vnkle <hi>Armineo</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> broyle, helped not a litle, for he was a valiant knight, and much eſtéemed of in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> But let vs leaue them, &amp; ſpeak of the Prince <hi>Brandizel,</hi> who purſued the Gyant. He rode ſo faſt, that ere the Giant came within a flight ſhot of the ſea, he ouertooke in a large plaine, and crieng alowde, bad him redeliuer the Princeſſe falſe traitour as he was. The Giant looked backe to ſée what it was, and ſéeing but one, though riding in haſt, he cared not for him, ſaue that not to be found vnprouided, he looſed the Princeſſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéens his armes, and ſet hir on ground: the Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him ſpake neuer a word, but drawing his ſword, hit him ſo great a blowe vpon the helmet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him boow his head to his breaſt, wherewith the Giant increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in cholar, and gaue him the like: this began the ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh betweene them, wherein the noyſe was ſo great, that the Princeſſe <hi>Clarinea</hi> before in a ſound retourned to hir ſelfe, and ſéeing the battaile with ſo little hope as that one onely knight ſhould aduenture hir deliuerance, fell into a ſound again, wherein ſhe had died for ſorrow, had not God <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:13855:159"/>When they had thus fought an houre, it was a wonder to ſée their bruſed armour with their backed ſhields, but euer the ſtéele coate defended the biting of their ſwords, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Brandizels,</hi> which made by Art Pagicke had this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that no mettall might pearce it. The Gyaunt was hurt in manye places, whereat as at the force of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſarie he was greatly eſtoniſhed &amp; blaſphemed his Gods in deſperate manner, which had made him ſtaye that good Knightes comming. The Princeſſe <hi>Clarinea</hi> ſéeing the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants bloud thus couer the ground, was very glad, and byr colour became freſh, which increaſed hir beautie: whereto alſo (Fortune willing to be fauourable) it was ſo that the prince <hi>Brandizel</hi> beholding hir, was enamored of hir beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and entirely loued hir. For his heart now ſet on fire angmented his conrage, and he buffeted the Giant ſo, that in ſhort time he vnarmed him in many places. In the end the Prince deſirous to giue end to the battaile, rayſed in his ſtirroppes, ſtroke a full blowe at the Gyant vpon the ſhoulder, that his ſword entered a handful, and the Giant fell dead. The Prince ſeeing him fall, preſently leaped from his horſe, and pulling off his helmet, went to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to recomfort bir, ſaieng: Madame, I beſéech you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in good part this little ſeruice at his handes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth to doo you much more. The Princeſſe verye ioyfull to ſée hir enimie on ground, and more glad to ſée hir friend ſo goodly a man, curteouſly anſwered. Noble knight you haue done ſo much for me, that with all that which my father hath, I ſhall not be able to requite it you, but if you wil that this good which you haue done me doo like me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, ſhew me ſo much fauour as to carrie me to the king my father, for bether will come the reſidue of the Gyants knights, &amp; then my libertie is to begin againe: the Prince gently taking bath her hands in his, kiſſed them &amp; ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. Madame if it pleaſe you we may retourne to the town from whence we came, for I beléene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe knights of whom you ſpake, are but few aliue to put vs in daunger,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:160"/>I left my companions fighting with them, who I am ſure hane done their parts, and yet they ſhall doo vs no wrong though they be many, But in farre greater ieopardie am I of my life by you, if you vouchſafe me not your ſeruice, wherewith the Princeſſe was nothing offended, for ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked very well his comely perſonage, but ſhe anſwered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Prince ſéeing the Princeſſe without a paltray, tooke hir vp behinde him, and with eaſſe paces rid towards the towne. In which way, the prince with many amorous words feaſted the princeſſe, and manifeſted to hir his loue, and after diſcloſing himſelfe alſo, he beſéeched hir to kéepe it ſecret, which ſhe did, reſoluing not withſtanding if hir father were ſo content, not to match otherwiſe. Well, néere the towne they came, where they ſawe a great troupe of Knights haſting ſo faſt as they might, and indéed they wer the King and his Knights, more then <hi>500.</hi> in number, who by the report excited to ſuccour their Princeſſe came to the towne, and finding almoſt all the Giants knights taken or ſlaine by the prince <hi>Clauerindo</hi> and <hi>Armineo,</hi> with ſuch aide as the towne affoorded, they altogether follow on, in the purſute of the Giant which had led hir awaye. Now there were of the companie, which a farre off aſcried the princeſſe behinde <hi>Brandizel,</hi> and learning that it was the Knight which rode to follow the Giant, they told it to the King, whereat he was very glad, and making much of the thrée ſtraungers, eſpeciallye of <hi>Brandizel,</hi> he ſpake on this wiſe. Sir knight, how ſhall I be able to requite this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which you and your companions haue ſhewed to me. Aſſuredly I know not, though I ſhuld giue you my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for were it not for you, I ſhould haue loſt this daye my daughter <hi>Clarinea,</hi> and with hir my ioye and pleaſure, which béeing loſt, what ioye ſhould I haue founde in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng? But tell me I pray you, how dealt you with that Gyant, for he was ſtrong and great. Sir ſayth <hi>Brandizel,</hi> offering to kiſſe his handes, which the King gentlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:13855:160"/>
               <p>Sir ſaith he, mightie Prince, my companions &amp; I, think our Fortune to be very good, in that we are thether arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued where we may doo ſeruice to ſo courteous a Prince, and it is reward ſufficient, your acceptation. As touching the Gyant, his ill purpoſe was his owne decaye, for bée is already dead, not farre from hence. The King wondered to heare tell that the Giant was dead, for by the report of his bigneſſe, he thought it impoſſible that one only Knight ſhould coape with him, and then much more making of the Princes, he imbraced them oftentimes, and deſired them to tell him their names, which at length they did. And the King vnderſtanding of their birthes, carried them with himſelfe towards the towne, where, in the waye hée tolde them who that Giant was, and what the cauſe was why he had come thether in ſuch ſort, ſaieng: My Lordes this Giant was called <hi>Lamberdo,</hi> Lord of the Iland of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> not farre hence, he hath ſince the time he was firſt knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neuer emploied his time to other aduantage but to rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and ſpoyling, and for this, he hath an Iland excéeding ſtrong, but very little, and ſcarce well peopled. In this he may defend him from any enimie, and beſtowing his ſpies in euery corner to watche for ſome ſuch cheuiſaunce, hée knew that my daughter <hi>Clarinea</hi> was in this towne with a few knights, ſo hether he made a voyage and had ſtolne hir away, but that God be bleſſed, ſuch valyant Knights as you, came in ſuch a time for hir ſuccour. While the King tolde this tale, they were within the towne walls, and as they entred through the ſtréetes, the whole towne gathered together to ſée the Prince which had ſtaine <hi>Lambardo.</hi> And then through the towne they came to the Kings pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, where they abode a great while.</p>

O Fortune how haſt thou bene froward to méee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all men. Firſt before I was borne I loſt my father, &amp; when I was borne my Mother was in ſorrowe and care for mée, and ſcarcely began I to knowe the world when I was banniſhed from her whome I loued better then my ſelfe. And nowe by chaunce haue I hene brought to the companie of a noble knight, with whome I might haue bene more friendlye acquainted, but the waues roſe vo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and haue carryed him awaie from mée as if I were vnworthie of anie good. When he had wept his fill, he went to one of the Caſtles, there to ſet ſuch thinges in ordes as were diſquieted by the death of theyr Lorde, and ſo comfort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woful Gyanteſſe, whom he afterward matched with one of the beſt knights of all thoſe whom the Gyant had left, giuing them liuerie and ſeaſon in that lande, and making others to ſweare obedience. Short time after hée would néeds depart, with full purpoſe to kéepe in the Sea, and not to depart till that he ſhould haue ſailed ſo farre, that no words might be heard of him in thoſe quarters. Therefore he tooke his armour, wherein was drawen the God of lous, in ſuch ſort as our aunceſtours were wont to paint him, with his eyes out, his bowe and arrowes in his hand: The picture béeing ſo liuely drawen, that <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> kuewe it was done by the wiſe <hi>Artemidoro,</hi> and therevppon he ſooke his name of that deuice, from which time hée neuer called himſelfe other then the Knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> vnder which name he atchieued many enterpriſes,

               </p>
               <p>Hauing put on his armour he tooke his leaue of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driana,</hi> for ſo was called the Daughter of <hi>Candramarte,</hi> and for remembraunce onely the ſhippe wherein hée firſt ſayled when hée leſt great <hi>Britaine,</hi> with two marriners to conduct it, whome he charged not to call by other name then the Knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> and to guide the ſhippe Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. When hée had ſo ſailed fiſtéene daies without chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to him anie thing worthie of recitall. It was ſo, that one morning by Sunne riſing, he ſawe a little boate paſſe by him, out of which he heard many cries, as if it had bene the labour of ſome woman, and thinking that there might be néede of ſome helpe, he was deſiraus to know what was in the ſhippe, and therevpon he commaunded to ioyne with them.</p>
               <p>Preſently there ftept vppon the hatches a ſadde aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient man with a white beard all armed ſaue the head, which demaunded what hée woulde. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſayde, I woulde knowe who is in your Shippe, for me thinkes I haue heard ſome woman complaine, and if it bée ſo, I will venture my perſon to doe her good. The auncient Knight behelde <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> &amp; taking him to be ſome knight of great bountis, eſpecially in that he had offered himſelfe ſo frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When hée had throughly behelde, he opened the matter on this ſorte. Aſſuredly good Knight, I thanke you for your great good will, and as it is not miſ beſéeming your outward beautie to haue ſome inwarde vertue lyke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>But know you that in this ſhippe there abideth a Gentlewoman making towards the great <hi>Britaine,</hi> there to complaine her to the King <hi>Oliuerio</hi> and his knightes, of the outrage which is done vnto her. Nowe becauſe our ſtaie is daungerous, I may not tell you farther of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, our enimies followe vs, and ſo reſt you with GOD. When the olde man had ſaide this, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> hauing
<pb facs="tcp:13855:162"/>deſire to know more, ſtaied him, and beſought him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more at large, for himſelfe was a Knight of that Court, and could tell him what remedie was to bée hoped for there. The olde man was loth to ſtaie longer, yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him ſay that he was of the ſame Court, hée tolde him in fewe wordes, that this Gentlewoman was the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Arguiroſa,</hi> one of the faireſt Ladies in the worlde, and a Princeſſe of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> onely heire to that kingdome. That her mother béeing dead, the King <hi>Arguidoro</hi> her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell in loue with a Gentlewoman of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> not ſo honeſt nor of ſo high eſtate, as wanton and of baſe birth: and louing her affectionately, after marryed her, to the diſpoſſeſſing of his owne childe. Then in the time of her Fathers life, there was in the court a knight called <hi>Rolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> beſides his great liuing, one of the ſtrongeſt knightes in all thoſe partes, but proude, and little reſpecting the whole worlde. That this Knight during the lyfe of the King was lyked of <hi>Ipeſca,</hi> and ſo ſoone as the King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidoro</hi> dyed of a ſodeyne diſeaſe, was promoted to the Kinges bedde by matching with the Quéene, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great reuenewes, that he nowe inioyed the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by force, and excluding the right heyre, none of the kingdome daring to gaine-ſaie him, for the moſt able are his night kinſmen, the other learne patience perforce. But that which worſt of all was, that to vndoe her rightfull claime, hée mindeth to marrie her with a kinſman of his, and to giue onely ſome little Towne to dwell in, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the title of the Kingdome after his owne dayes to a ſonne the which hée hath begotten on his Quéene <hi>Ipeſca.</hi>

               <p>I am kinſman ſayth he to the Princeſſe, béeing her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brother, and therefore I haue aduentured to reſcewe my néece, but not knowing any remedie at home, becauſe my power is not equall with <hi>Rolandos,</hi> I haue brought her out from thence, and I determine to goe to the great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> where as I haue heard there are many valyaunt
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:13855:162"/>knightes, eſpecially a new Knight, of whom I haue heard eſpecially ſince the great feaſts there holden. If this Knight helpe me not, I know not who may with-ſtand <hi>Rolando.</hi> Thrée nightes and dayes haue we bene vppon the Sea: onely I, the Lady, two Gentlewomen, and our Marriners, and I beléeue that there come after vs <hi>Rolandos</hi> knightes. Nowe haue I tolde you the whole of your deſire, and I beſéech you tell vs what newes you knowe of that good knight.</p>

But the Princeſſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſo much moueth me, that albeit I was purpoſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where, yet would I gladly fight with <hi>Rolando</hi> in the Princeſſe behalfe.</p>
               <p>The auncient knight was verie ſad to heare that the newe Knight was not in <hi>Britaine,</hi> but well eyeng this knight which had ſo tolde him, and made profer of helpe, he ſtoode in doubt whether to take or refuſe, by and by he diſcouered two ſhippes vnder ſayle, and by theyr toppes to be of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> whereat ſtriking himſelfe on the breaſt hée cryed out. O moſt vnhappie that wée are, héere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Rolandos</hi> Knightes which will take vs, and béeing brought againe to <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> we ſhal there receiue moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el death, and he wept, curſing the houre of his departure, the Princeſſe <hi>Arguiroſa</hi> hearing the complaintes which her vnckle made, his greate ſorrowe which he ſuſteyned, the extreame daunger they were in, and the cauſe why hée did it, tooke it as heauie, and wofully bewailed their miſerie</p>
               <p>When <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſawe them in this plight, hée much pittyed them, eſpecially <hi>Arguiroſa,</hi> which the Princeſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13855:163"/>
                  <hi>Oliuia</hi> not remembred might haue well contented him. Therefore he willed them to get vnder the hatches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and to let him ſhifte for theyr ſafetie, the olde man thinking that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> woulde defend them by ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng that they were his people, did ſo, not ceaſing yet to feare the worſt and to pray earneſtly for their eſcape. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicleer</hi> leapt into the Princeſſe ſhippe, and ſate vpon the brimme therof to ſée what would happen, till that the other ſhippe came néere, and that he which was the Captaine commaunded to grapple, and eſpyeng <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> with a proude voice badde him ſaye both who himſelfe was, and what people he had in his ſhip, and not faile in any point. Whereto <hi>Roſicleer</hi> by and by aunſwered. I am a ſtranger in theſe parts, and farther it is not reaſon that you knowe who they are y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are with mée, for we kéepe our way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moleſting thée or thine. The Captaine angrye for his ſhort ſpéech ſaid vnto him.</p>
               <p>I will ſtrike thy head into the water, vnleſſe thou aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me directly to my queſtion, and ſo ſaieng he halde and puld <hi>Roſicleer</hi> to haue forced him. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> thus rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated roſe vp, and with his gauntlet gaue the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch a blow vpon the helmet, that his braines flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone his head, and preſently he fell into the water, where the weight of his armour kept him downe. Straight waies more then twentie knights well armed and well angered for the death of their captaine, altogether with their ſwords in their hands ſmote at him. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> drawing out quéene <hi>Iulias</hi> blade, ſtroke againe with ſuch courage, that at thrée blowes thrée knightes were ſlaine, and thoſe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knewe his great proweſſe drew backe, making no great haſt to come néere him. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> knowing his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies feare, leaped into their ſhippe, and there laide ſo about him that in ſhort ſpace he killed halfe of them. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Arguiroſa</hi> and the auncient knight nowe beganne to ſhew themſelues aboue boord, and they greatly wondered at his manhoode.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:13855:163"/>
               <p>So ſhortly after <hi>Roſicleer</hi> was ralone in his enimyes ſhippe without reſiſtaunce, either all beeing ſlayne, or all ſlaine or wounded, or ſlaine, wounded, or by flight eſcaped: for <hi>Roſicleers</hi> owne ſhippe was loſt in the garboyle. Now retourned hée to <hi>Arguiroſas</hi> ſhippe wherein ſhe with the olde man receiued him, <hi>Roſicleers</hi> ſalutation to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe after this exploit was in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>Madame what hath ben done your ſelfe hath ſéene, but for a recompence thereof I ſhall thinke my ſelfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatiſſied if you will venture that into my hands, which you dare hazard into the handes of the new Knight. For I promiſe you I will as willingly ieopard my perſon as hée ſhall. Now when <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had ſo ſayde, the Princeſſe &amp; the olde man ſtayed a good while without ſpeaking word, for the conſideration of theyr owne daunger with recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie if this man fayled, made thein the more warie, and ſo betweene the examination of <hi>Rolandos</hi> valour and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcleers</hi> hardineſſe.

               <p>The curteſie valiant knightes which you haue offered me, though vnworthie, hath bene ſo great that I want the holdneſſe to accept more, yet becauſe you carſt defended mée from death by the vanquiſhing of <hi>Rolandos</hi> knights, and now againe you will needes take vppon you a further matter, rather not to refuſe you, then willing to trouble you againe, I will returne with you to my Countrey, and commit wholy to your handes the whole ordering both of my ſelfe and my cauſe: her vnckle gaue his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto, and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> thanked them much. So they ſailed to <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> where by the waye <hi>Roſicleer</hi> caſting in his thought how to redreſſe the Princeſſe wrong, to the leaſt diſpleaſure of her and her vnckle which were loth to be knowen, determined as a ſtraunger to enter the land &amp; to demaunds iuſtice as it were againſt a perſon not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.
<pb facs="tcp:13855:164"/>To which deuice after he had made them priuie, and promiſed that they ſhould not bée diſcloſed till it ſo ſerued for their auaile, they were better comforted, and ſailed with ſo good winde that they tooke landing in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen néere the place where the king was, taking lande, he made the Princeſſe to put on a muſter, and the olde knight to couer his head, beſides bidding both to counterfaite for the time ſome ſtraunge behauiour, either in holding downe their heads, or in biſguiſing their attire. To either of them he gaue his horſe, and himſelfe mounted vpon a courſer the beſt of all <hi>Candramartes</hi> ſtable. In the coole of the euening they fooke their way to the néereſt Citie, where then were many knights and Ladies comming out of the citie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport them in the ſhadow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſicleer</hi> being of a comely perſonage and ſo luſtelye mounted foorth to bée ſeene, and was well lyked off and praiſed amongeſt them all. And they followed on theyr iourney towarde the gates of the Citie, the king at that time came accompanied with his nobilitie to ſolace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the fielde as at other times before he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The king rode vpon a mightie horſe, with trappings and harneſſe moſt of beaten golde, his horſe being ſo braue, and himſelfe ſo fierce and ſterne to looke too, that it woulde haue daunted a right good knight to haue but ſpoke to him. So ſoone as the Princeſſe and her vnckle ſawe him, they counterfaited the beſt that they could, and for feare theyr blond ſonke downe into their bellies. The valiant Gréeke knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was <hi>Rolando</hi> whom he ſought for, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing afraide of his terrible lookes, but rather glad to haue met with him ſo conuenienly, and in the companie of ſo many knights, willed the Princeſſe and the knight to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. So came they all thrée before the king, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſpeaking to him and ſaieng.</p>
               <p>Mightie king, in iuſtice ſtay thy horſe to heare a poore Ladies complaint, and to right the greateſt wrong y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer was offered to a Gentlewoman. Why ſhe complaineth to

Now the while <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſpake thus, <hi>Rolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> behelde him verie well, lyking both his courage &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, and albeit of his owne nature hée neither feared God nor kept iuſtice in things which perteyned to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet hearing in <hi>Roſicleers</hi> diſcourſe, himſelfe to bée made on now and then as of a right Iudge, and that hée would not conſent that other then iuſtice ſhould be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his kingdome, hée was tickeled therewith, and bad <hi>Roſicleer</hi> tell on, for he woulde heare his matter willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſtrayning his voite, that what hée ſaide might bée hearde and noyſed <expan>

               <p>Knowe you mightie king that the father of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman was Lorde of great poſſeſſions, which marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng with an honourable woman begat on her this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Few yeares after his wife deceaſing, this Lord marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo another woman, by whome he had no childe, after that the Lorde himſelfe dyed alſo, the ſtepdame remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aliue, and ſhortly marryeng with another man whome in her huſbandes dayes ſhée had a liking too. This man ſir king, matching with the mother in lawe, hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſed the true heire of her lawefull inheritaunce, inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much too, as béeing ſo diſſeyſed, ſhée hath in no wiſe béene conſidered off as ſuch a mans Daughter. Nowe, ſéking her redreſſe abroade, it was my chaunce to méete with her, to whome after ſhée had declared her caſe, I made offer for to fight for her with anye which impugned her right. Theſe are therefore to require thée O King, ſo to tender her ſuite in the honour of iuſtice, eyther that ſhe may lawfully inioye her owne, or that you authoriſe the lyſtes, that the conquerour maye enter by a lawefull meane.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ended, expecting the kinges aunſwere, who neither warily nor aduiſedly waieng and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:13855:165"/>the drifie and purpoſe of this parable, aunſwered. Sir Knight, thy demaunde is iuſt, and the Knight which hath done this wrong, cannot chooſe but take the one of the two, therefore tell mée who thou art, and I will ſend for him to aunſwere thy challenge. Bée it as the king hath ſpoken it ſayde <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> And knowe for truth that the Knight which hath done this iniurie is thy ſelfe: the Gentlewoman which receiued it is the Princeſſe <hi>Argui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſa</hi> which héere ſtandeth by me, the lawefull inheritour as thy ſelfe knoweth of this kingdome: thou without iuſt title haſt intruded vpon it: therefore doe that which thy mouth hath witneſſed to bée iuſt. When <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had ſayd, <hi>Rolando</hi> much amaſed at his great preſumption, and not béeing able to bridle his choller, aunſwered deſpire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Thou fooliſh and vnhappie Knight, howe hath ſo greate madneſſe entered into thée as to appeare before mée with ſuch a demaund, that were it not for the ſentence which I haue giuen, I would ere this haue abated thy pride: but I will not kéepe long from thée the rod of due correction, I am content to take the battaile, and with the conditions which thou haſt named, harde inough I warrant thée for thy ſelfe, and that woman, whome I will ſo cage vp that ſhée ſhall no more ſéeke ſuch knightes as thou art. When the King had thus ſayde hée went on his waye, and all thoſe that heard the demaunde of <hi>Roſicleer</hi> were much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed at his boldneſſe, for though he was bigge, yet ſéemed he nothing ſo ſtrong as to reſiſt <hi>Rolando,</hi> preſently it was publiſhed throughout the whole Citie, and the battayle was appointed to be on the morraw, where you ſhuld haue ſeene moſt part of the Towne praie to God for the right of their naturall Queene, many ſcaffolds were erected to ſée the liſts.</p>
               <p>The auncient Knight vnckle to the Princeſſe was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alberto,</hi> and he had a Nephewe a ſtrong and luſtye Knight, dwelling a mile frome the Cittie in a Caſtle of

               <p>
                  <hi>ROlando</hi> made no account that night of the battayle which he was to fight the next daye, for he thought no harme could happen him, though there had bene ten more ſuch Knights as his aduerſarie was. The daye being come he aroſe and armed himſelfe, where enquiring whether the Knight his aduerſarie were in fielde or no, it was tolde him yea, wherefore he made the more haſt, &amp; comming to the lyſtes with a troupe of armed Knightes for his more honour, he defied the Knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> for ſo was <hi>Roſicleer</hi> then called, of the deuice which he bare: the Kings wordes were to this effect. Tell me now fooliſh Knight, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not repent thy yeſterdayes challenge, wouldeſt thou not giue much not to be héere now: whereto <hi>Roſicleer.</hi> No aſſuredly I repent me not, for if thou vanquiſh me I looke for naught but death, which I ſet ſo lyght by, as in ſo right a quarrell, I would venture my life twentye times, but thou oughteſt rather to repent thy ſelfe, and to haue remorce of thy ill dealing. <hi>Rolando</hi> hearde him ſaye ſo, and began to laugh aloude. Art thou (ſaith he) become a Philoſopher? who wanting ſtrength of armes to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe honour, when they lye ſtriking themſelues on theyr couches, can talke gallantly, which they account for as great a glory. Thou truſts more I perceiue in thy tongue Philoſophie, than in chinalrie or manhoode, and yet to be ſpoken off after thy iuſt puniſhment, thou wilt dye forſooth in defence of Iuſtice. But if death in ſuch a quarrell be ſo acceptable, prepare thy ſelfe for it, for thou ſhalt ſtaye no longer, then the proofe of my ſpeare.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13855:166"/>
               <p>So ſaieng, <hi>Rolando</hi> tourned the raines of his horſe to take the carrier. The meane while that the Iudges were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on their bench, and that the Quéene with hir Ladyes had taken the windowes to beholde the battaile, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Arguiroſa</hi> ſate vpon hir palfray all heauie, and onely accompanied with <hi>Alberto,</hi> for none els durſt make anye countenaunce of well meaning towardes hir, for feare of the king. But to our matter, theſe two knightes putting their ſpurres to their horſes, with their ſpeares in theyr reſtes, ranne together, and with their force the earth ſhooke, and their ſpeares burſt in ſunder. The King in the midſt of the carrier being borne vpon his crupper, and <hi>Roſicleer</hi> not moued at all, ſaue that his horſe peantrells burſt with the ruſhing, and both knights lyghted downe, where began a fierce battaile on foote, either laieng at other ſo thicke, that their ſhields were burſt in péeces, and themſelues ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that either followed the other ſtaggering and not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his gate. The beholders of the battaile wer much amazed at <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> and at the daunger wherein he put the King, but if any meruailed, much more did <hi>Rolando,</hi> which both felt it, and could iudge what terrible ſhakes hée hadde borne both on horſe and foote, and he thought in himſelfe, neuer to haue met with the like knight, one or other, man or Gyant. Euer <hi>Roſicleers</hi> nimbleneſſe helped him much, for he could ſtep eaſily aſide and eſcape the blow: but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi> found a want of his horſe, for he was ſo heauie, that he could not auoyd one blowe. At length ſtarke tyred, his bones aking for very paine of trauaile, he woulde haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken breath, but fearing to make his aduerſarie priuie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he forced himſelfe quickly to kill or be killed, and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blowes vpon <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> he ſo galde him, that the lookers on miſtruſted <hi>Roſicleers</hi> partie. But would hée or not (<hi>Roſicleer</hi> enduring the vttermoſt) <hi>Rolando</hi> was faine to giue ouer, wherat <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> though not hauing ſo much néede, yet not to take ſo foule on, did the like.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:13855:166"/>
               <p>They two leaning their breaſts vpon the pomels of theyr ſwordes, behelde each other a long while, where <hi>Rolando</hi> thinking it not beſt ſo to ende the matter, but take it vp ſome other way, ſpake to <hi>Roſicleer,</hi> ſaieng. I had not thought Knight, that ſo much courage had bene in thée, and yet ere the ende it will little further thée againſt mee: but for that I am giuen to loue and like of ſuch knightes as thou art, I wil vſe clemencie towards thée, which I neuer determined to doo towards one, which hath ſo much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me. This it is, I will that thou leaue off the battayle which thou haſt in hande for the Princeſſe <hi>Arguiroſa,</hi> and from thencefoorth that thou abide in my Court, where I will doo thée that honour which thy perſon meriteth, and I will beſtow a liuing vppon thée, wherewith thou ſhalt liue contentedly, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> héere well perceiuing what hée went about, ſayd vnto him: I would willingly <hi>Rolando,</hi> that as thou haſt in ſhew offered me great honour, for the which I thanke thée, ſo that thou wuuldeſt in déede per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme another thing, which ſhould be leſſe impayre to my preſent honour then the leauing of the battaile: the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile as thou ſayſt would I gladly end, not onely for mine owne daunger which I am like to be in, but for thy ſake, whom I rather wiſh to amend his fault by liuing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the Ladye to hir owne, then by dying in a wrong cauſe to hazarde the vtter perdition of thy ſoule: and for truth take this, that I will chooſe to dye, than to ſuffer hyr cauſe to be loſt by my colluſion. Take therfore ſome other meanes to leaue this battaile, for this will not ſuccéede, or let vs fight it out, for I hope in God, that he will defende the innocent. When <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had ſayde this, <hi>Rolando</hi> thinking that his owne gentle ſpeach had made his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie more bolde, became mad outright, and forgetting hys wearineſſe, tooke his ſworde with both his handes, and therwith he ſtrake <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſo hard on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> headpéece, that he made him boowe both handes and knées vnto the grounde,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:167"/>the blow being ſo heauie, as if a Tower had fallen vppon him. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> riſing vp acquited it him, that he made him ſtagger fiue or ſixe paces backward. And betwéene them the combat was renued. Nowe this eſpeciallye refreſhed the poore Princeſſe <hi>Arguiroſa,</hi> that hir Knight troubled his enimie more now then at the beginning. And not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was apparant that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> had the better, for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi> began to be wearie, and coulde not moue out of his place. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> knowing the aduauntage, and willing to ende the battaile the ſooner both for the contentment of the Princeſſe, and the ſafetie of <hi>Rolandos</hi> life, whome he iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a valiaunt knight, offered againe the conditions before mentioned: but it was not <hi>Rolandos</hi> good hap, and true it is, that thoſe which liue ſo wickedly, dye common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as deſperately, leaſt they ſhould repent their faultes, and finde mercie: But <hi>Rolando</hi> more then madde at the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſte which was offered him, wold heare naught, but ſtrake at <hi>Roſicleer</hi> with all his force, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> ſtept aſide, and the ſworde fell vpon the ground ſticking vp to the hyltes. The whiles that <hi>Rolando</hi> haled at his ſworde, <hi>Roſicleer</hi> diſcharged his blowe with great ſtrength, and cutte the necke in ſunder from the bodie. Wherewithall the whole multitude ſhowted, but in diuers tunes, ſome for ſorowe of the Tyraunts death, but moſt crying: Liue thou <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiroſa,</hi> our Quéene and Ladie. Then albeit ſome of the Kings friendes woulde haue aduenged his death, they durſt not ſignifie it, the people being ſo bent after the newe Quéene. The Knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> when the battaile was ended, thanked God, and demannded of the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whether ought els were to be performed, for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Princeſſe <hi>Arguiroſa</hi> to hir kingdome. To which, all ſayde no, and the Trumpetts ſounded. Yet ſate the Princeſſe vppon hir Palfraye till there came to hir of the moſt principall Knightes, and others Citizens, which now all feare ſet aſide, durſt diſcouer their good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:13855:167"/>
               <p>The Princeſſe therewith and the knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> with hir vnckle <hi>Alberto,</hi> rode in great honour to the Pallaice, where, that preſent day, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princeſſe was crowned Quéene, the chiefe Lords kiſſing hir hand, in the name of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Commons. After this, there was no talke but of the marriage of the Quéene, euery man as he wiſhed, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Knight of <hi>Cupide,</hi> which hir ſelfe more deſired then they all, but knowing that the Knight of <hi>Cupide</hi> had elſe where beſtowed his liking (which ſhe gathered by like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoode of ſpeaches which ſhe had heard in the ſhip, by the déepe ſighes which he hourely fetched, and eſpecially by his deuice, which did not argue in a newe beginner) ſhe ruled hir paſſion the beſt ſhe might, and for this time moued him not therein. Afterwards, ſhe ſent for <hi>Rolandos</hi> wife, hir mother in lawe to kéepe hir companie, but the report was, that for anguiſh of minde ſhe had ſlaine hir ſelfe. Well, yet ſhe commaunded them both to be interred as belonged to the Kings and Quéenes of that land. <hi>Roſicleer</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Kingdome ſixe dayes, at the great intreatie of the Quéene to helpe all things to good order.

<pb facs="tcp:13855:169"/>and they all thrée layde at the Emperour, but it had bene better for them not to haue bene ſo haſtie, for ere long they receiued iuſt reward for their inſolencie. For the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour cleaued one of them to the ſcull, and another from the ſhoulders downward, the other as he made haſt to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, was taken ſhorter by the legges. For the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour albeit very inclinable to any reaſonable pitie, yet was he in this poynt very rigorous, not to ſpare the diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of virginitie, his ſaying was: That it quenched the naturall loue betwéene father and mother, ſiſter and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, betwéene kiffe and kinne: that the baſtard borne ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome came to good purpoſe: that it was partlye the ſinne of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> &amp;c. And for his owne fault, it was in déed méere ignoraunce or rather conſtraint, and thereby the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, or perhappes the deteſting of it himſelfe, made him more ſeuerely exact the kéeping of chaſtitie in others.

Yet to couer himſelfe, he made the Gentlewomen ſit downe, himſelfe ſitting by them, and to tell him whether they went, and wherefore they were in thoſe partes. The Gentlewomen glad and faine that they might without daunger tell of what Countrey they were, and what theyr arraunt was thetherwarde, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, we are belonging to the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> Daughter to the King of this lande: the cauſe of our comming, is, that long time agone our Ladie loſt hir Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the prince <hi>Edward</hi> prince of <hi>Britaine,</hi> I hath neuer ſince heard of him. For his ſake ſhée hath remayned a widow in the Moneſtarie of the riuer, demeaning a verye ſorrie lyfe, as pent vp in a religious Cloyſter. Hir beléefe was alwayes that he was dead, till within theſe fiftéene
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:13855:169"/>dayes, ſhe dreamed that ſhe ſawe him aliue, and that hée came by Sea to this land, verie merrie, of the ſame age which hée was off when he firſt lefte her, which dreame ſhe hath dreamed thrée nightes together, the laſt night of the thrée there appeared to her an auncient man much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking her for her diſtruſt, whereat the Princeſſe, though hardlye perſwaded, yet béeing ſo admoniſhed, the better hath credited that nights viſion, and hath ſent vs to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houſe, dedicated to our Ladie the bleſſed virginne, with rich offerings, and many good deuotions for his ſafe returne. Whence after we were retourning by this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, theſe Knightes beſet vs, and had rauiſhed vs, but that wée cryed ſo lowde that you hearde vs, and you haue thankes bée to God well eaſed vs of them, and for your ſo greate curteſie, if it ſo pleaſe you to ride with vs, I doubt not but our miſtreſſe will well conſider you. The Emperour much reioycing at the great conſtancie of his wife <hi>Briana,</hi> and deſiring to diſcouer himſelfe, aſked the Gentlewomen if anie of them had ſéene the Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> or no. Whereto <hi>Clandeſtria</hi> aunſwered. Yea ſir Knight verie well, and I woulde that God woulde once ſhew him me, I ſhould knowe him by his louely face, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all other knightes which I haue euer ſéene. I will ſée that preſently ſayde the Emperour, and ſo ſayeng hée put off his helmet: and how now ſaith hée, whome take you me for. O ſay they both, your ſelfe are Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> &amp; knéeling downe before him would haue kiſſed his handes, and they earneſtly intreated him to goe with them to the monaſterie of the riuer. The Emperour conſented gladly. For I haue ſaith he as great deſire to ſée her, but héere not far hence there is a knight which ſtayeth for me, him muſt we ſéeke and carrie in our companie, for hée is the man next vnto God, to whome I am moſt beholding, for by him haue I béene deliuered from priſon and from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment.

               <p>THE Emperour by the waie declared to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen and to the knight of the: Sunne who he was, not Prince <hi>Edward</hi> as they thought, but in his name <hi>Brianas</hi> bridegrome, and ſo forth of that matter, which you may conceiue by that you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Whereat the Gentlewomen were not a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but nothing ſorrie. And with the knight of the Sunne the Emperour entered into farther counſaile in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he might make the king <hi>Tiberio</hi> priuie to his fact, and carrie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe <hi>Briana</hi> into <hi>Greece.</hi> Whereto the knight of the Sunne counſailed thus. My Lorde, you knowe the faith of a Prince, a bond verie ſtraight for kings and great Lords, as touching the preſeruation of their honour in promiſe, for which many times many haue preferred the truſt laide vpon them before the ſafetie of their neere kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. This I ſay for that peraduenture <hi>Tiberio</hi> will be right glad to haue matched his daughter with you, yet for the Prince <hi>Edwards</hi> ſake, comming vnder his ſafe conduct, hée
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13855:170"/>may not take it in good part, or if he did, had not king <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerio</hi> iuſt cauſe to be angrie being ſo abuſed, as vnder his word to haue loſt his ſonne, and ſubiects withall, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile is therefore, for the better diſpatch of your buſineſſe, and auoiding of béeing ſhent, if you venture raſhly vppon an enimie not reconciled, that you go ſecretly to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, and carrie awaie the Princeſſe from thence, ſcarce letting her ſelfe know whether ſhe ſhall goe, ſaue that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde you you may leaue a letter which ſhall ſignifie the whole effect of that which is paſſed. By this meanes if the king of <hi>England</hi> bewaile the death of his ſonne, the king <hi>Tiberio</hi> may complaine of the loſſe of his daughter, and in time when theſe fores are ſkinned; there maye friendſhippe be made on either part. The Emperour liked well this counſaile, and giuing him many thankes tolde him that he would put it in effect. So two daies they kept companie, in the meane time happening nothing worth the telling.</p>
               <p>The third daie comming to a croſſe ware well trode, they ſawe a pauilion pitched, and not farre off twelue Gentlewomen clothed in blacke, and hauing verye ſadde countenaunces, at the tent doore they ſawe thrée knightes which were theyr kéepers. When the Emperour and the Knight of the Sunne approched, the Gentlewomen cryed out, whereat the knight of the Sunne ſtayde, and ſpake vnto them.</p>
               <p>Gentlewomen, as well by your countenaunces as by your outeries, we perceiue you are diſtreſſed. Shew vs now the cauſe thereof, and if the thing be ſuch as that we may remedie it, we will doe our beſt to doe it. One of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of them aunſwered. Sir your curteous words makes vs the bolder to vtter our griefe. Therefore knowe you that I haue a ſiſter called <hi>Eliſandra,</hi> Dutcheſſe of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noma,</hi> and marryed to a Knight the moſt wicked man that was euer borne, for hée hath ſtaundered her with ſuch a miſreport, as the lyke hath not bene heard off.
<pb facs="tcp:13855:171"/>So it is that my ſiſter and he haue béene marryed eyght yeares and haue had no children, wherefore he fearing that after his deceaſe the Dukedome ſhoulde retourne to her kinne, as by right it ſhould, béeing her onely inheritaunce, and minding to eſtabliſh the ſtate in his owne name, hath ſubborned a deſperate perſon to challenge her of adulterie. By which meanes ſhe being executed as falſe to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, all her lands and goods are forfayted to the huſband, as it were to make him amendes of his wiues wrong. Nowe this ſlaunder is apparaunt to all men, but becauſe the Duke offereth that the combat ſhall bée graunted to him which ſhal gaine-ſaie the ſlaunder, the matter is made the lykelyer, and is borne out, though not by ſtrong hand, yet by pollicie, and yet no man dare oppoſe himſelfe to the challenger. For there is a knight in the land called <hi>Aridon,</hi> Lord of the blacke woode, by reporte the ſtrongeſt Knight which euer was in theſe partes, albeit verie like vnto the Duke in his ill liuing, him hath the Duke made his friend and accuſer of the Princeſſe. For a plot of ground adiacent to his ſegniories, his accuſation lyeth thus, that with himſelfe ſhée committed adulterie, whereas though he was a long ſoiourner in his Court, yet he neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her to it, or woulde euer moue her in it, for hée knewe his aunſwere. But the matter was thus canua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the while the Duke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kept at the Court of the King <hi>Tiberio,</hi> thether word is brought of the falſe packing of the Dutcheſſe and <hi>Aridon.</hi> The Duke preſently complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the king, and both parties are ſent for in all haſt. <hi>Aridon</hi> being firſt aſked confeſſeth it, and is acquited by his confeſſion. As (by the waie) our lawe in this caſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiteth the man once confeſſing it, though otherwiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo greate an offender, and onely ſtretcheth to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in reſpect of her faith giuen at marriage. Nowe what coulde the Princeſſe doe ſtanding before the King, and accuſes not of beare ſaie, but by himſelfe, with whome ſhée is fayde to haue lyen? yet denyeth ſhée it. Well, the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13855:171"/>Duke charging her with it, and ſhée purging her ſelfe, ſhée was faine to require reſpite for prouiding a ſufficient Knight to maintaine her innocencie. Yet was ſhée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to priſon vnder ſure kéeping, and there is a daye ſet for the tryall, <hi>Arydon</hi> beeing the accuſer, agaynſt whome I doe not thinke that anie man in her defence, though the cauſe bée righteous dare ſhewe himſelfe, for we haue tarried héere theſe. <hi>20.</hi> dayes, and haue not founde anie. Now becauſe héere are croſſe wayes, in which it is likely that many knightes ſhould paſſe, we determine to abide the reſt of the prefixed time. And this is the cauſe ſir knight why we mourne, and ſo ſhe ended wéeping bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</p>
               <p>The Emperour and the Knight of the Sunne pittyed them much, meruailing ſo vngodly dealing coulde haue anie place to ruſt in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> but God is wiſe ſaye they, yea, and ſéeth his time. So the Knight of the Sunne tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a part with the Emperour, ſayde to him. My Lorde you ſée good cauſe binding me to pittie the Dutcheſſe in her extreame néede, if you bée pleaſed therewith, I will goe aunſwere for her in the Court of king <hi>Tiberio.</hi> In the meane time it will be beſt for you to goe to the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the riuer, the moſt ſecretly that you maye, and I will not fayle to certifie you from the Court if I heare ought which might auaile you being knowen. This béeing done, I will with Gods helpe come to <hi>Greece,</hi> where I looke to finde you verie merry. The Emperour was loth, but ſéeing the vrgent neceſſitie he was content, and anſwered, that he wold not be againſt his pleaſure, although it would grieue him to be ſo long without his companie, but at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> ſhall we méete.</p>
               <p>Therevppon the Knight of the Sunne tourned to the Gentlewomen, ſaieng. Gentlewomen, your mourning hath ſo much gréeued this Knight and mée, that although his affaires lie other where and that he cannot be preſent, yet for his ſake will I goe with you to the Court, there to
<pb facs="tcp:13855:172"/>aunſwere for the Dutcheſſe if ſhe be ſo content. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle women willingly accepted of the knight, and not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing longer but to thanke him, they pulled downe their tent and to horſe backe they go. By the way he had much talke with <hi>Eliſea,</hi> for ſo was the Dutcheſſe ſiſter named, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting her, and ſhe requeſting him to make ſpéede, for we lacke not many daies of our appointed time, when if wée faile we ſhall looſe a good cauſe for lacke of pittie in knights aduenterous.

               <p>THE Knight of the Sunne and the Gentlewomen with their Knightes ridde towardes the Citie of <hi>Ratisbona,</hi> where the King <hi>Tiberio</hi> and his Court for that time lay. Thrée dayes almoſt they trauayled, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of naught that might be tolde you, till towards noone vpon the thirde days they met with a faire Gentlewoman vppon a palfray, which ſaluted them courteouſlye in this manner: God ſaue you ſir knights, I praye you tell mée whether you are going to the Court of King <hi>Tiberio</hi> or no, for if you goe thether, I haue certaine newes to tell you.</p>
               <p>Marrie ſayde one of the Knightes, that we doo, what doo you commaunde vs thether faire Gentlewoman?

I am content with theſe conditions ſaith ſhe, and ſo I accepte of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>Nowe Sir Knight, truth it is, that riding this waye, I muſt of force paſſe ouer a Bridge, ſtretching ouer <hi>Danubia,</hi> not paſſing two myles from the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Ratisbona,</hi> ouer which you muſt alſo paſſe, if you woulde goe to the Citie, This Bridge ſayth ſhe, is kepte
<pb facs="tcp:13855:175"/>by a Knight called <hi>Florinaldes,</hi> for the loue of a Ladie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Albamyra,</hi> equally beloued of two Knights, the one is this <hi>Florinaldes,</hi> the other is an Earle named <hi>Orfeo,</hi> and they two haue bene at long ſtrife for hir loue. She to bée ridde of the one, ſhe careth not whether, hath commaunded that in hir preſence, they ſhould ſeuerally kéepe this paſſage fifteene dayes ſpace, promiſing that he which doth beſt ſhall be hir Knight. <hi>Florinaldes</hi> hath bene the firſt, and hath kepte this Bridge twelue dayes in <hi>Albamyras</hi> preſence, where are many Knights and Gentlewomen. Nowe, it béeing ſo néere the Courte, there come daylye manye good Knightes to prooue themſelues, but he hath the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye of them all, and his prayſe is ſpredde farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade.</p>
               <p>This morning, my ſelfe riding towardes <hi>Ratisbona</hi> for certayne buſineſſe I haue there, woulde haue paſſed the Bridge, but I coulde not be ſuffered, except I woulde haue confeſſed <hi>Albamyra</hi> to be the fayreſt Ladye in all <hi>Hungarie.</hi> This if I woulde not doo, they bad me bring ſome Knight that ſhoulde winne the paſſage for me. When I hearde this, I called to ſée the beautie of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myra,</hi> that I might iudge whether it were ſo or no. Then was I ledde into a rich Tent, wherein <hi>Albamyra</hi> ſatte accompanyed with manye Gentlewomen, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde hir at the full: but truely, if my Glaſſe at home lye not, wherein I was woont to ſée mine owne beautye, hyrs is nothing equall to mine. So I tolde them that for ought I hadde ſéene, I muſt bee fayne to retourne backe, and to finde a Knight, which woulde breake the paſſage.</p>
               <p>Now the gift which I demaund of you ſir Knight is, that heerevpon you iuſt with <hi>Florinaldes,</hi> and in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of my beautie againſt hirs, be you aſſured of the victorie.</p>
               <p>When the gentlewoman had ſaid thus, thoſe that were
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13855:175"/>preſent, laughed a good, and the Knight of the Sunne to ſhifte hyr off, aunſwered.</p>
               <p>Gentlewoman, if your buſineſſe had bene ſo great to the Court, as you would haue vs thinke, you would not haue ſtayed for ſo ſmall a matter. The Gentlewoman ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angrie, replied ſhortly. Call you it ſo ſmall a matter? marke what I ſaye, you are not ſo curteous as I tooke you for, if you ſo little eſtéeme womens ſutes, you béeing a Knight. Now know you, that a woman eſtéemeth hir beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aboue all, and that there is no iniurie ſo great for a woman, as to ſay that another is fairer then ſhe: I tell you that I had rather be called any other name of reproch, then not a well fauoured woman, and being as I am, I account my ſelfe much fayrer then <hi>Albamyra,</hi> or rather would I al my great buſineſſe vndone, then to confeſſe that which the Knight of the Bridge doth will me too. Now ſith you haue giuen me this graunt, performe it, or otherwiſe during my lyfe I will complayne me of you. The Knight of the Sun &amp; thoſe which wer with him, laughed to ſée the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman ſo hotte, for the lyght regarding of hir beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and they ſayd: Sith we muſt paſſe the Bridge, wée will ſée the beautie of <hi>Albamira,</hi> and if it bee leſſe then yours, then will we doo our beſt, that you ſhall paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled.</p>
               <p>Of the one part be you ſure quoth the Gentlewoman, that my beautie is more, and if I had the maintenaunce which <hi>Albamyra</hi> hath, <hi>Florinaldes</hi> or the Earle <hi>Orfeo</hi> would rather quarrell for my beautie than for hyrs. At thys and other like things they laughed till they came to the Bridge, where they ſawe a bigge Knight armed, and a fayre riche Tente pitched, with certayne Knightes and Gentlewomen walking by the Ryuer ſide, who ſo ſoone as they ſawe theſe Knightes come, gathered vnto the Tent.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne and his company offered to ride ouer the Bridge, but there came a Gentlewoman
<pb facs="tcp:13855:176"/>out againſt him, ſaying: Sir Knight this Bridge is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you by <hi>Florinaldes,</hi> ouer may you not paſſe, vnles you iuſte with him, or confeſſe that <hi>Albamira</hi> is the faireſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman in this Kingdome, and that <hi>Florinaldes</hi> is the Knight which beſt deſerueth hir, the which alſo muſt theſe Gentlewomen ſaye which are in your companie, or bring Knightes to aunſwere for them.</p>
               <p>We could be content aunſwered the Knnight of the Sunne, to agrée to theſe conditions which you ſpeake off, but the Gentlewomen in our companie make ſuch account of theyr beautyes, that they will rather retourne backe, then confeſſe that which you woulde.

                  <hi>Florinaldes</hi> and <hi>Albamyra</hi> heard all this, and preſently they cauſed the Tent dore to be ſet open, wher theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſawe <hi>Albamyra</hi> amongeſt the Gentlewomen, much excelling them all, which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take vp a freſh laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Knight of the Sunne ſéeing theſe thrée Knightes thus caſt downe, ſpake vnto the Gentlewoman which had
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13855:176"/>brought them thether. Gentlewoman, this Knight is no babe you ſée, were it not better for vs to ſaye as he ſaith, then might we go frée. And the rather, for that I haue ſéene <hi>Albamyra,</hi> which in my eyes is much fairer then you.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed Marie, ſaith the Gentlewoman, if <hi>Albamira</hi> be ſaiter then I, it is for hir apparell onely, but ſith you haue promiſed this, you muſt performe it, and although I gaine nothing héerein, yet ſhall it doo me good to ſée you flye from your ſaddle, for the litle ſkill you haue in diſcerning beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Albamira</hi> heard this, and the other Gentlewomen, and knowing that this was the Gentlewoman which had bene there before, they laughed much at hir, whereat ſhée waxed angry.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne then tooke a ſpeare from the ratler, and called for <hi>Florinaldes.</hi> Then ranne they toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch force, that they made the Bridge to ſhake. <hi>Florinaldes</hi> onely burſt his ſpeare vppon the Knight of the Sunne, but the Knight of the Sunne bare <hi>Florinaldes</hi> ouer and ouer ſo ſtrongly, that he had a ſore bruſe and might not riſe, his Knygtes tooke him in theyr armes into his Tent, where he was heauie: and it is vncertaine whether more grieued with the ſore of his bruſe, then the ſhame of his fall, ſo to be foyled before his Miſtreſſe: but if I may meddle in ſchoole poyntes, I thinke he had rather burſt an arme, then ſo to haue cracked his credite with both Ladie and friendes, ſuch as manye reſort thether from <hi>Tiberios</hi> Court to ſée him iuſte.</p>
               <p>And the Knight of the Sunne ſéeing <hi>Florinaldes</hi> ſo vnhorſed before his Ladye, was as ſorrie for him, and preſentlye departed.

               <p>Sir Knight, it appeares thou art both young and a ſtraunger in this Countrie, for if thou wert of yeares, or kneweſt <hi>Arydon</hi> which nowe talketh with thée, thou wouldeſt not bée ſo hardie as to defie him in preſence, and were it not for the King my Lorde, I woulde in ſome wiſe tell thée of thy rudeneſſe, but there néedeth no ſuch haſt, I hope I ſhall haue time inough, ſith thou canſt not betract the battayle, whereto thy ſelfe haſt firſt made of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but let vs goe to it preſently, and ende it in this place. <hi>Aridons</hi> high diſdaine ſore diſpleaſed the Knight of the Sunne as appeared by his looke, but hée refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for honour to the King, and for the reſt hée deſired

               <p>The whileſt all the beholders much praiſed the Knight of the Sunne for the beſt Knight liuing, as well commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his courage as his actiuitie. The Dutcheſſe <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandra</hi> likewiſe hauing now ſome hope by her knight, gate her coulour againe, and her ioye was as much as her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſorrowe. But you haue not yet hearde the worſt of the wicked Duke, for <hi>Aridon</hi> reuiued: whome when the knight of the Sunne ſawe raiſing himſelfe vp, he came haſtely, and holding the point of the ſwoorde againſt <hi>Ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> throate hée ſpake ſaieng. Thou ſhalt dye falſe <hi>Ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> vnleſſe thou confeſſe the treaſon that thou haſt deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the Dutcheſſe, and if thou doeſt dye in this obſtinate minde of concealing ſo greate outrage, thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardeſt thy ſoules health. <hi>Aridon</hi> as it were halfe awake, and yet not ſo loth to die as ſtroken with terrour of his owne conſcience, aunſwered. Thy wordes haue abaſhed me more then the death which thou threateneſt, the fault which I haue committed, hath bread a greater horrour in my fleſh, but make the Iudges come néere and I wil declare the whole.</p>
               <p>The Knight of the Sunne called the Iudges, they comming néere heard theſe wordes of his owne mouth, the ſubſtaunce of the Dukes ſhifting to wring his wiues inheritaunce to himſelfe, in ſuch manner as you haue
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13855:179"/>heard in <hi>Eliſeas</hi> reporte. The Iudges ſtraight wayes declared it to the king, who deteſting their fact, cauſed the Duke to be apprehended, and both to be executed in that place.</p>
               <p>For albeit many of his nobles intreated for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yet the king ſo abhorred the villanie that naught auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: and at this time was the lawe firſt enacted in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie,</hi> that the lawe of puniſhment for whoordome, ſhoulde ſtretch as wel to the man as to the woman, and that equal penaltie ſhoulde bee aſſigned to lyke offendours, whereas before the men eſcaped, the women only were in daunger. Now after this execution, the Dutcheſſe <hi>Eliſandra</hi> was ſet at large, and the Quéene <hi>Auguſta</hi> receiued her with great honour into her companie. The Knight of the Sun was verie deſirous to leaue the Citie: but the king deſired much to knowe him, and to haue him abide for ſome time in his Court. In the time of his abode, the Knight of the Sunne grew in more familiar acquaintaunce with the king, and was much lyked of him, becauſe he ſéemed to reſemble the Princeſſe <hi>Briana,</hi> but one daie the king importuning the young Knight to knowe his kindred, vſed ſuch lyke wordes.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, we thanke you heartely for the paines that you haue taken in the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Pannonias</hi> behalfe, and for the maintaining of her honour, wherby if ſhe haue receiued commoditie of liuing and auoiding ſhame: ſo haue I receiued ſome quietneſſe in my Realme by the open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of ſuch malefactours, and their puniſhment will be occaſion of feare in others: for this cauſe I haue willed you to ſtaie héere, as thereto I praye you heartely, but I praie you let me know your name and where you were borne, for I knowe not how to call you. The Knight of the Sunne well nurtured in the Souldans Court, after his humble thankes for his Maieſties moſt gratious proffer and the promiſe of acceptaunce, béeing a thing in déede verie conuenient for the certifieng of the Emperour,
<pb facs="tcp:13855:180"/>began as followeth. For your maieſties fauour I ſhall moſt willingly do your highneſſe ſeruice, and for the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe, I am gladde that the equitie of her cauſe furthered my attempt, and for my name and Countrie, I can better tell you the ſtorie of my life ſince I came to yeares, then declare that. Yet am I called the Knight of the Sunne by my deuice, and my education hath bene in the Souldans Court at <hi>Babylon,</hi> thether I being brought by the kings ſonne in lawe, the king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> when I was but a child, and as it hath bene tolde me, found in a little boate vpon the Sea, for my life hetherto it hath bene in armes, and that doe I meane to purſue. The king and thoſe which were with him were greatly amazed that hée had come from ſo farre a Countrie, and had bene found vppon the Sea, and that he knew no more of his eſtate, but they thought that he was of ſome noble birth. The king than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, and in this order the Knight of the Sunne ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the king <hi>Tiberio</hi> for certeine dayes, where he gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many friends, &amp; one onely enimie, by name <hi>Florinaldes,</hi> which could not forget the ſhame receiued before his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, although it had done him no ſcath: for in the ende <hi>Albamira</hi> preferred him before the Earle <hi>Orfeo.</hi> So as I ſaye, yet <hi>Florinaldes</hi> ſéeing the honour of the Knight of the Sunne daily to increaſe, to the diſcredit of the borne <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian,</hi> his ſtomacke roſe againſt him, and one day he ſet vppon the Knight of the Sunne at vnawares, but to his owne loſſe, had not the knight of the Sunne bene more mercifull, after they were made friends. But let vs breake off this ſtorie to diſpatch the Prince of <hi>Luſitania</hi> out of <hi>England.</hi>

Nowe is there ſtayed in the Court the Prince <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> ſtraungelye ſurpriſed with the loue of <hi>Oliuia,</hi> and vſing the helpe of his ſiſter <hi>Rodaſylua</hi> to the perſwading of <hi>Oliuia.</hi> One day the laſt I take it he vnfolded his griefe vnto her, telling her, that vnleſſe ſhe found the meanes, hée ſhoulde héere leaue his life in a farre Countrie. The matter is mine olde ſute that you wot off, my deſire is, that at leaſt I maye bée aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of her good will. Sure I am if I moue the king in it I ſhall obteine it. The Princeſſe <hi>Rodaſylua</hi> mooued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed with her brothers affliction, promiſed the vttermoſt of her paines, and within a while after ſhe had ſome talke with the Princeſſe about that matter, her wordes tending to like effect.</p>
               <p>Madame, you knowe right well the great loue which ſince I came to this Court I haue borne vnto you, and how I haue done you ſeruice in all that I was able, that which more is, in what manner I haue abſented my ſelfe from my parents onely to be in your companie, which if you knowe and confeſſe to be true, you muſt likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that, that which I ſhall ſaie nowe, rather procéedeth of good zeale towardes your honour, then of anie purpoſe to worke mine owne contentment, though I cannot denie but that if I obtaine, it will content me highly.

<pb facs="tcp:13855:181"/>ſo will I tell you my minde flatly. You knowe that you are the onely inheritrixe of this kingdome, that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king, my Lorde, muſt néeds marrie you with ſuch a one as may equall your eſtate, both for the naturall care which he hath ouer you in reſpect that you are his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and for the profit which ſhall thereby redounde to his ſubiectes, which cannot be well gouerned, the ſeate wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Princeſſe angrie at the heart with this ſpéech, for it was the thing moſt contrarie to her wiſh, replied ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Madame <hi>Rodaſilua,</hi> if I had thought that the zeale and loue which hou haue profeſſed and I doe confeſſe had tended to this iſſue, I ſhould leſſe haue lyked your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and I cannot thinke well of it, that either you ſhoulde breake with me of ſuch matters, or ſhoulde haue commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication thereaboutes with your brother, who as you ſaie lacketh boldneſſe to diſcouer his affection, which cannot bée, doth he loue ſo earneſtly when he vouchſafeth not to ſpeak vnto me but by a meſſenger. I ſuſpect your wordes, perhappes if I had heard the man ſpeake, I might haue iudged in his countenaunce whether hée had lyed, yea, or no.</p>
               <p>But for truth you knowe I am of young yeares at
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13855:181"/>this inſtant, neither haue I will to marriage, I pray you therefore name it no more vnto me, and yet when I am of yeares I may not chooſe my huſband, and I am at the Kings commaundement whom I muſt obey. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Rodaſylua</hi> ſo ſharply rebuked by the Princeſſe <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia,</hi> and thereby gathering the lyſtle good will ſhe bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir brother, demaunded pardon of hir ſpeach, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hir lodging, whether ſhe ſent for the Prince <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> and to him ſhe tolde the whole talke, with the Princeſſe aunſwere, willing him notwithſtanding not to giue ouer, but to make a better ſhewe, as if hir aunſwere miſliked him not, and couertly to labour to the King for his conſent. This can he not denie you, and after you may winne the Princeſſe: for as yet hir excuſe is but of yeares.</p>
               <p>The Prince liking hir counſayle, departed from the Princeſſe his ſiſter, and the nexte daye finding the King at leaſure, he required his Maieſtie of a ſecret matter. The King commaunded thoſe in preſence to auoyde, and tooke him to a windowe, where the Prince after his duetye done, beganne on this ſort. With your graces fauour (I truſt) I haue this long time ben a welwiller to your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> and to haue hir to wife, whereto if it might pleaſe your highneſſe to condiſcende, I knowe my parents would well agrée thereto, for the great loue which they beare to your Maieſtie, &amp; to me their ſonne, &amp; thereby ſhould I take my ſelfe to be the beſt rewarded for my long tarrieng, that euer Prince was: I humbly beſéech your highneſſe to let me knowe your minde héerein. The demaund of the Prince was nothing ſtraunge to the king <hi>Oliuerio,</hi> for he ſuſpected this matter long before, &amp; therfore his anſwere was ſhort, that he was content to accept him for ſonne in lawe, as well for his owne worthineſſe, as for his birth, and for the friendſhip betwixt their parents: yet ſaith he, you ſhall giue me leaue to thinke thereon, &amp; you ſhal haue a more reſolute anſwere: the prince hoping y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:13855:182"/>deſire woulde take effect. Nowe the King to knowe the Princeſſe minde therein, went himſelfe to the princeſſe lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where finding hir alone, he counſayled hir in this ſorte. It hath pleaſed God that the Prince <hi>Edwarde</hi> thy brother ſhuld be loſt in the realme of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing none other childe but thee, thinke it conuenient both for mine owne liking, and the common profitte of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, to haue thée maried with ſome Prince of lyke eſtate. This haue I thought on a long time, and now vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation had with ſome ſpeciall of my counſaile, I haue founde one: a Prince which both for his power may, and for his courage will, and for his nobilitie is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to beare ſwaye in ſo great an eſtate as this is: him am I content to take for ſonne in lawe, and to commend my title vnto you. This Prince is <hi>Don Siluerio</hi> Prince of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> whom you know right well, a comly knight of perſonage, valiant in armes, of a couragious ſpirite: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, vertuous, and in his dealings circumſpect, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſpeach, and of high eſtate, as I knowe fewe lyke.

The king thinking that ſhe had ſpoke as ſhe ment, and that hir young age hadde bene hir onely ſtaye, tooke in good parte this excuſe, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng hir notwithſtanding to remember what he had ſayd. So the King departed and the Princeſſe remayned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better apayed by the Kings liking of hir aunſwere, but hir hope was, that <hi>Roſicleer</hi> would come, and that he being preſent, the Kings minde might be altered as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Don Siluerio,</hi> and for this cauſe ſhe made many a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vowe for his ſpéedie retourne, but aboue all ſhe looked for <hi>Fidelia.</hi> The King at his retourne, cauſed <hi>Don Silue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> to be called, to whome he declared his talke with his daughter, and hir aunſwere, adding moreouer, that héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he thought the matter poſſible inough, for hir good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, beſides his, whereof he might be aſſured. <hi>Don Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerio</hi> was the gladdeſt man aliue and thanking the King for ſo high fauor, for that time he departed from the King, but the Princeſſe grew to be more melancholick then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for ſhe eſpyed what courage he had taken by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which the king had giuen him.
